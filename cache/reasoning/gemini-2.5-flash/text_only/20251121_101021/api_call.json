This is the initial observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on previous moves or the active piece that led to this state, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of any past actions.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board exhibits a severe height disparity. Columns C0-C3 are relatively high (heights 13-15), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates an enormous \"canyon\" on the right side of the board. The priority is to build up the right side (C4-C9) to even out the board and create flat surfaces for future line clears. Care must be taken not to create new holes in the taller left section while doing so.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the vast empty space on the right, the primary strategy must be to **deposit incoming pieces into columns C4-C9**. The goal is to fill this void systematically, preferably from left to right within that empty section (C4 moving towards C9) to create a new base. Since the active piece is unknown, specific placement advice is impossible, but the general principle is to prioritize filling the gap. Avoid placing pieces in C0-C3 unless it creates an immediate line clear or is absolutely necessary to prevent a hole.\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right).\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

Without knowing the active piece, any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) would be a guess and potentially detrimental. The only safe action when the piece is unknown is NO_OP, as it pauses the piece's descent for a moment, hopefully allowing the next observation to reveal the piece.\n\nThe board has a very uneven height, with columns C0-C3 being high and C4-C9 being completely empty. My strategic goal is to fill the right side, but this is impossible without knowing the piece.\nTherefore, the most optimal action here is to do nothing and wait for the piece to be revealed in the next observation.\nthought: The active piece is UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to plan an optimal placement or even a safe move. Any movement or rotation could lead to a disadvantageous position or create unwanted holes.

This is the initial observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on previous moves or the active piece that led to this state, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of any past actions.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board exhibits a severe height disparity. Columns C0-C3 are relatively high (heights 13-15), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates an enormous \"canyon\" on the right side of the board. The priority is to build up the right side (C4-C9) to even out the board and create flat surfaces for future line clears. Care must be taken not to create new holes in the taller left section while doing so.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the vast empty space on the right, the primary strategy must be to **deposit incoming pieces into columns C4-C9**. The goal is to fill this void systematically, preferably from left to right within that empty section (C4 moving towards C9) to create a new base. Since the active piece is unknown, specific placement advice is impossible, but the general principle is to prioritize filling the gap. Avoid placing pieces in C0-C3 unless it creates an immediate line clear or is absolutely necessary to prevent a hole.\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right).\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: The current game state indicates that the active piece is UNKNOWN. This means I cannot plan a specific placement. Without knowing the active piece, any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) would be a guess and potentially detrimental. The only safe action when the piece is unknown is NO_OP, as it pauses the piece's descent for a moment, hopefully allowing the next observation to reveal the piece.\n\nThe board has a very uneven height, with columns C0-C3 being high and C4-C9 being completely empty. My strategic goal is to fill the right side, but this is impossible without knowing the piece.\nTherefore, the most optimal action here is to do nothing and wait for the piece to be revealed in the next observation.\nthought: The active piece is UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to plan an optimal placement or even a safe move. Any movement or rotation could lead to a disadvantageous position or create unwanted holes. The only logical and safe action when the active piece is unknown is to perform a NO_OP, hoping the piece will be revealed in the subsequent observation, allowing for informed decision-making. The board has a large gap on the right, but I cannot address it without the piece information.\nPlacement_Plan: no_op\nmove: (no_op, 1)"
