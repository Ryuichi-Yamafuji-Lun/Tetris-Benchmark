Despite the complex `Aggregate Stats` which seem to encode a dense state, the primary board height summary shows a fresh start.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    The board appears to have been completely cleared, suggesting either the start of a new game or a highly effective sequence of moves leading to a perfect clear. Without previous context, the precise nature of the change cannot be determined, but the outcome is a clean slate.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With no previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed. However, achieving a completely clear board is generally the result of highly effective gameplay.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Currently, no areas require immediate attention for clearing. All columns are at height zero. Attention should be on establishing a low, flat foundation as new pieces arrive.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the clear board and an `UNKNOWN` active piece, the primary strategy is conservative build-up:\n    *   **Foundation:** Prioritize creating a flat, low-lying base to maximize future options.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** Prevent any internal gaps in the stack.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Keep the board as open as possible to accommodate various incoming pieces.\n    *   **Tetris Prep (Optional):** If an I-piece is desired for high scores, consider leaving a single column (e.g., C9) open for a vertical clear, but this is less critical than maintaining flatness initially.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, specific placements are impossible, so general good building practices are key.\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right).\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it's impossible to plan any specific rotations or horizontal movements to achieve an optimal placement. Any movement or rotation would be random and likely suboptimal. The safest action in this situation is to do nothing (`NO_OP`) to allow the game to update, hopefully revealing the piece in the next state, or for the piece to fall one step, which might clarify its type. A `HARD_DROP` would commit to an unknown placement, which is not advisable.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP",

Despite the complex `Aggregate Stats` which seem to encode a dense state, the primary board height summary shows a fresh start.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    The board appears to have been completely cleared, suggesting either the start of a new game or a highly effective sequence of moves leading to a perfect clear. Without previous context, the precise nature of the change cannot be determined, but the outcome is a clean slate.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With no previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed. However, achieving a completely clear board is generally the result of highly effective gameplay.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Currently, no areas require immediate attention for clearing. All columns are at height zero. Attention should be on establishing a low, flat foundation as new pieces arrive.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the clear board and an `UNKNOWN` active piece, the primary strategy is conservative build-up:\n    *   **Foundation:** Prioritize creating a flat, low-lying base to maximize future options.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** Prevent any internal gaps in the stack.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Keep the board as open as possible to accommodate various incoming pieces.\n    *   **Tetris Prep (Optional):** If an I-piece is desired for high scores, consider leaving a single column (e.g., C9) open for a vertical clear, but this is less critical than maintaining flatness initially.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, specific placements are impossible, so general good building practices are key.\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right).\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: The board is completely clear, indicated by the column heights `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. However, the `Active Piece` is listed as `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it's impossible to plan any specific rotations or horizontal movements to achieve an optimal placement. Any movement or rotation would be random and likely suboptimal. The safest action in this situation is to do nothing (`NO_OP`) to allow the game to update, hopefully revealing the piece in the next state, or for the piece to fall one step, which might clarify its type. A `HARD_DROP` would commit to an unknown placement, which is not advisable.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP"
