The board is completely empty, as indicated by the `Column Heights Vector` being `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    No previous moves have been made, so there is no last move to evaluate.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is entirely clear. All columns are at height zero. There are no holes or high stacks requiring immediate attention. The focus should be on establishing a strong foundation.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    With an empty board, the primary strategic goal is to begin building a stable, flat base while ideally setting up for future Tetris (4-line) clears. This usually involves keeping one side of the board clear to create a vertical well for an 'I' piece. Without specific information about the current falling piece (which is likely contained within the 'Aggregate Stats' but is uninterpretable without a key), it's difficult to make a perfectly optimized first move. However, a general approach is to start shifting pieces to one side to maintain a flat profile or begin building the Tetris well.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`):\nI-piece (line):\nRotation 0: IIII\nRotation 1: I\n           I\n           I\n           I\n\nO-piece (square):\nOnly one rotation: OO\n                   OO\n\nT-piece:\nRotation 0:  T\n            TTT\nRotation 1: T\n            TT\n            T\nRotation 2: TTT\n             T\nRotation 3:  T\n            TT\n            T\n\nL-piece:\nRotation 0:   L\n             LLL\nRotation 1: L\n            L\n            LL\nRotation 2: LLL\n            L\nRotation 3: LL\n             L\n             L\n\nJ-piece:\nRotation 0: J\n            JJJ\nRotation 1: JJ\n            J\n            J\nRotation 2: JJJ\n              J\nRotation 3:  J\n             J\n             JJ\n\nS-piece:\nRotation 0:  SS\n            SS\nRotation 1: S\n            SS\n             S\n\nZ-piece:\nRotation 0: ZZ\n             ZZ\nRotation 1:  Z\n            ZZ\n            Z\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. Start with any necessary rotations ('rotate_right' or 'rotate_left')\n2. Then position the piece horizontally ('left' or 'right')\n3. **CRITICAL: You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. If using `textual_representation`, remember the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\n7. Use `reflection` and `game_trajectory` for high-level strategic guidance and historical context.\n8. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n9. Think about the immediate best moves for the current step.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation shows it near the top left. The rotation visualizations indicate that rotating it right (clockwise once) is the most critical first step to set up a line clear later.\nmove: rotate_right\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning about the optimal move and why, using all available information fields]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation suggests I need to move it right by two positions to fit into a gap and clear one line, but since I am limited to one step, the most immediate action is to move right to initiate the positioning.\nmove: (right, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

  "output": "thought: The board is completely empty, as indicated by the `Column Heights Vector` being `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The 'Aggregate Stats' contains a lot of numerical data, but without a key, it's impossible to interpret what '19, 19, 19, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 22, 19' signifies in terms of the current falling piece. However, the `Reflection on Past` section mentions \"without specific information about the current falling piece... it's difficult to make a perfectly optimized first move. However, a general approach is to start shifting pieces to one side to maintain a flat profile or begin building the Tetris well.\"\n\nGiven an empty board and no information about the current piece, a good initial strategy is to move the piece to one side. This prepares for creating a Tetris well (a 4-block high empty column on one side) or simply building a flat foundation. Moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable arbitrary choice to begin this process, as it shifts the piece away from the center, which is often desirable on an empty board. I will assume the piece starts roughly in the middle and moving right is the first step in positioning it.\nthought: The board is currently empty. The `Column Heights Vector` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. There is no visual representation of the falling piece, and the `Aggregate Stats` do not clearly identify the current piece type or its position in a human-readable format. Given this lack of specific information, the most general strategy on an empty board is to begin moving pieces to one side to either create a flat base or set up a Tetris well. Since I cannot see the piece or its orientation, I'll make a conservative move to initiate positioning. Moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable first step to shift the piece away from the center, assuming it starts there.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

The board is completely empty, as indicated by the `Column Heights Vector` being `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    No previous moves have been made, so there is no last move to evaluate.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is entirely clear. All columns are at height zero. There are no holes or high stacks requiring immediate attention. The focus should be on establishing a strong foundation.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    With an empty board, the primary strategic goal is to begin building a stable, flat base while ideally setting up for future Tetris (4-line) clears. This usually involves keeping one side of the board clear to create a vertical well for an 'I' piece. Without specific information about the current falling piece (which is likely contained within the 'Aggregate Stats' but is uninterpretable without a key), it's difficult to make a perfectly optimized first move. However, a general approach is to start shifting pieces to one side to maintain a flat profile or begin building the Tetris well.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`):\nI-piece (line):\nRotation 0: IIII\nRotation 1: I\n           I\n           I\n           I\n\nO-piece (square):\nOnly one rotation: OO\n                   OO\n\nT-piece:\nRotation 0:  T\n            TTT\nRotation 1: T\n            TT\n            T\nRotation 2: TTT\n             T\nRotation 3:  T\n            TT\n            T\n\nL-piece:\nRotation 0:   L\n             LLL\nRotation 1: L\n            L\n            LL\nRotation 2: LLL\n            L\nRotation 3: LL\n             L\n             L\n\nJ-piece:\nRotation 0: J\n            JJJ\nRotation 1: JJ\n            J\n            J\nRotation 2: JJJ\n              J\nRotation 3:  J\n             J\n             JJ\n\nS-piece:\nRotation 0:  SS\n            SS\nRotation 1: S\n            SS\n             S\n\nZ-piece:\nRotation 0: ZZ\n             ZZ\nRotation 1:  Z\n            ZZ\n            Z\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. Start with any necessary rotations ('rotate_right' or 'rotate_left')\n2. Then position the piece horizontally ('left' or 'right')\n3. **CRITICAL: You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. If using `textual_representation`, remember the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\n7. Use `reflection` and `game_trajectory` for high-level strategic guidance and historical context.\n8. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n9. Think about the immediate best moves for the current step.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation shows it near the top left. The rotation visualizations indicate that rotating it right (clockwise once) is the most critical first step to set up a line clear later.\nmove: rotate_right\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning about the optimal move and why, using all available information fields]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation suggests I need to move it right by two positions to fit into a gap and clear one line, but since I am limited to one step, the most immediate action is to move right to initiate the positioning.\nmove: (right, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: The board is completely empty, as indicated by the `Column Heights Vector` being `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The 'Aggregate Stats' contains a lot of numerical data, but without a key, it's impossible to interpret what '19, 19, 19, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 22, 19' signifies in terms of the current falling piece. However, the `Reflection on Past` section mentions \"without specific information about the current falling piece... it's difficult to make a perfectly optimized first move. However, a general approach is to start shifting pieces to one side to maintain a flat profile or begin building the Tetris well.\"\n\nGiven an empty board and no information about the current piece, a good initial strategy is to move the piece to one side. This prepares for creating a Tetris well (a 4-block high empty column on one side) or simply building a flat foundation. Moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable arbitrary choice to begin this process, as it shifts the piece away from the center, which is often desirable on an empty board. I will assume the piece starts roughly in the middle and moving right is the first step in positioning it.\nthought: The board is currently empty. The `Column Heights Vector` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. There is no visual representation of the falling piece, and the `Aggregate Stats` do not clearly identify the current piece type or its position in a human-readable format. Given this lack of specific information, the most general strategy on an empty board is to begin moving pieces to one side to either create a flat base or set up a Tetris well. Since I cannot see the piece or its orientation, I'll make a conservative move to initiate positioning. Moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable first step to shift the piece away from the center, assuming it starts there.\n\nmove: RIGHT"
