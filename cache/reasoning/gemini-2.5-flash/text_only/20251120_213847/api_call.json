Without previous context, the effectiveness of past moves cannot be assessed.\n\n**Areas needing attention:**\nThe current low heights on C0-C2 should be integrated into a broader, flat base. The extensive empty space on the right side of the board (C3-C9) presents a significant opportunity.\n\n**Strategic insights:**\nPrioritize building a wide, flat foundation across the entire board. Utilize the empty right side to extend the base without creating significant holes. The goal is to maximize future placement options and prepare for efficient line clears.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven the very open board, a `NO_OP` or `RIGHT` move might be evaluated depending on the incoming piece, but without a next piece, a specific action is hard to recommend. Let's provide a general action that keeps the game moving or allows for more reflection. `NO_OP` is usually a safe bet if no immediate placement is obvious or if time is needed, but typically, we are always dropping. Given the simple state, a `SOFT_DROP` is generally useful for quickly placing pieces.\n\nSince I am asked to provide *one* action, and I don't know the next piece, a neutral move is best, or one that prepares for the incoming piece. If the objective is to *reflect*, the action should logically follow the reflection. My reflection focuses on building a *flat* base. Often, the first piece should just get down quickly to start that base.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is falling, and `SOFT_DROP` will accelerate that.\n\nSOFT_DROP\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right).\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

  "output": "thought: I have received the board state (Column Heights Vector) but no information about the current falling piece or any upcoming pieces. Without knowing the active piece, its shape, and its initial orientation, it is impossible to formulate an optimal \"Placement_Plan\" involving rotations or specific horizontal movements. The board is largely empty on the right side.\n\nIn the absence of piece information, the most neutral and generally safe action is to `SOFT_DROP`. This allows the piece to fall one row, advancing the game state without making any potentially incorrect rotational or horizontal adjustments. A `HARD_DROP` would be too committal. `NO_OP` would simply stall for a single frame, which is less productive than a soft drop. Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` or `ROTATING` would be pure guesswork. Therefore, `SOFT_DROP` is the best choice to move the game forward given the lack of information.\nPlacement_Plan: SOFT_DROP\nmove: SOFT_DROP",

Without previous context, the effectiveness of past moves cannot be assessed.\n\n**Areas needing attention:**\nThe current low heights on C0-C2 should be integrated into a broader, flat base. The extensive empty space on the right side of the board (C3-C9) presents a significant opportunity.\n\n**Strategic insights:**\nPrioritize building a wide, flat foundation across the entire board. Utilize the empty right side to extend the base without creating significant holes. The goal is to maximize future placement options and prepare for efficient line clears.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven the very open board, a `NO_OP` or `RIGHT` move might be evaluated depending on the incoming piece, but without a next piece, a specific action is hard to recommend. Let's provide a general action that keeps the game moving or allows for more reflection. `NO_OP` is usually a safe bet if no immediate placement is obvious or if time is needed, but typically, we are always dropping. Given the simple state, a `SOFT_DROP` is generally useful for quickly placing pieces.\n\nSince I am asked to provide *one* action, and I don't know the next piece, a neutral move is best, or one that prepares for the incoming piece. If the objective is to *reflect*, the action should logically follow the reflection. My reflection focuses on building a *flat* base. Often, the first piece should just get down quickly to start that base.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is falling, and `SOFT_DROP` will accelerate that.\n\nSOFT_DROP\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right).\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: I have received the board state (Column Heights Vector) but no information about the current falling piece or any upcoming pieces. Without knowing the active piece, its shape, and its initial orientation, it is impossible to formulate an optimal \"Placement_Plan\" involving rotations or specific horizontal movements. The board is largely empty on the right side.\n\nIn the absence of piece information, the most neutral and generally safe action is to `SOFT_DROP`. This allows the piece to fall one row, advancing the game state without making any potentially incorrect rotational or horizontal adjustments. A `HARD_DROP` would be too committal. `NO_OP` would simply stall for a single frame, which is less productive than a soft drop. Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` or `ROTATING` would be pure guesswork. Therefore, `SOFT_DROP` is the best choice to move the game forward given the lack of information.\nPlacement_Plan: SOFT_DROP\nmove: SOFT_DROP"
