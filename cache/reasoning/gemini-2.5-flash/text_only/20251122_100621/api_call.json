The current board state shows a significant challenge: columns 0-3 are uniformly high at 13 blocks, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This creates a large, deep \"pit\" or \"canyon\" across the right two-thirds of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context or knowledge of the last move, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The critical area is the transition from column 3 (height 13) to column 4 (height 0). This massive height difference of 13 lines needs to be carefully addressed. The entire right side (columns 4-9) is an empty void that needs to be built up. Care must be taken to not create holes when filling this space.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal is to build up columns 4-9 strategically and create a flat surface for future line clears, especially bridging the gap with the high left wall. This requires careful piece placement to avoid creating irrecoverable holes. Given the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, it's impossible to recommend an optimal immediate move, but the overall strategy must focus on raising the height of the right side uniformly while keeping potential line clears in mind. Building up column 4 is the most immediate task to connect with the existing structure.\n\nGiven the `UNKNOWN` active piece, I cannot make an informed optimal move. I will select a `NO_OP` as it's the safest option when lacking critical information to prevent potentially detrimental placements.\nNO_OP\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n***CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER use the terms 'DROP', 'HARD_DROP', or 'SOFT_DROP' in your output, as they are invalid actions in this environment and will result in a NO_OP.***\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: rotate_right\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: [action_name_from_list]\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: left\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

The current board state shows a significant challenge: columns 0-3 are uniformly high at 13 blocks, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This creates a large, deep \"pit\" or \"canyon\" across the right two-thirds of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context or knowledge of the last move, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The critical area is the transition from column 3 (height 13) to column 4 (height 0). This massive height difference of 13 lines needs to be carefully addressed. The entire right side (columns 4-9) is an empty void that needs to be built up. Care must be taken to not create holes when filling this space.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal is to build up columns 4-9 strategically and create a flat surface for future line clears, especially bridging the gap with the high left wall. This requires careful piece placement to avoid creating irrecoverable holes. Given the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, it's impossible to recommend an optimal immediate move, but the overall strategy must focus on raising the height of the right side uniformly while keeping potential line clears in mind. Building up column 4 is the most immediate task to connect with the existing structure.\n\nGiven the `UNKNOWN` active piece, I cannot make an informed optimal move. I will select a `NO_OP` as it's the safest option when lacking critical information to prevent potentially detrimental placements.\nNO_OP\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n***CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER use the terms 'DROP', 'HARD_DROP', or 'SOFT_DROP' in your output, as they are invalid actions in this environment and will result in a NO_OP.***\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: rotate_right\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: [action_name_from_list]\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: left\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: The board has a significant disparity in height, with columns 0-3 at 13 units high and columns 4-9 completely empty. The active piece is currently UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to plan any optimal rotations or horizontal movements. Making a random move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could lead to a very poor placement, creating holes or an uneven stack. Therefore, the only safe and rational action is to perform a NO_OP and wait for the piece type to be revealed in the next turn.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP"
