The board is currently completely empty, with all column heights at 0.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous move to evaluate in this context.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is pristine and entirely clear. No specific areas require immediate attention due to existing holes or rough terrain. All columns are at height 0.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    With an empty board and an `I_Line` as the active piece, the primary strategic goal is to initiate a well-structured base for future line clears, specifically aiming for Tetrises. The `I_Line` is perfect for this. The most efficient use of the `I_Line` on an empty board is often to place it vertically along one of the side walls (e.g., column 0 or column 9) to establish a 1-wide Tetris well. This sets up a clear strategy for subsequent pieces to build around this well, maximizing Tetris opportunities.\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n***CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER use the terms 'DROP', 'HARD_DROP', or 'SOFT_DROP' in your output, as they are invalid actions in this environment and will result in a NO_OP.***\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

The board is currently completely empty, with all column heights at 0.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous move to evaluate in this context.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is pristine and entirely clear. No specific areas require immediate attention due to existing holes or rough terrain. All columns are at height 0.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    With an empty board and an `I_Line` as the active piece, the primary strategic goal is to initiate a well-structured base for future line clears, specifically aiming for Tetrises. The `I_Line` is perfect for this. The most efficient use of the `I_Line` on an empty board is often to place it vertically along one of the side walls (e.g., column 0 or column 9) to establish a 1-wide Tetris well. This sets up a clear strategy for subsequent pieces to build around this well, maximizing Tetris opportunities.\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n***CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER use the terms 'DROP', 'HARD_DROP', or 'SOFT_DROP' in your output, as they are invalid actions in this environment and will result in a NO_OP.***\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: The board is completely empty. The active piece is an I_Line. The optimal strategy for an I_Line on a clear board is to place it vertically along one of the side walls to create a Tetris well. I will aim to place it vertically in column 0. The I_Line spawns horizontally, so it first needs to be rotated to a vertical orientation. After rotation, it will need to be moved left to reach column 0.
