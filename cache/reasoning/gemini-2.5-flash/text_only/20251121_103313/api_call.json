The immediate focus is on intelligently placing the first piece, the `I_Line`, to establish a favorable foundation.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:** The `I_Line` is excellent for clearing lines. With an empty board, the most effective strategy is to place it horizontally across the bottom. This creates a wide, flat base, preserving options for subsequent pieces and facilitating future Tetris setups by keeping the board low and open.\n\n**Action (derived from reflection):**\nROTATE_RIGHT (to orient it horizontally, assuming default is vertical)\nNO_OP (assuming this implies moving it to the middle or letting it drop, if further movement isn't specified, but the question only asks for reflection. If I had to give an action, it would be to move it to the center or right and drop it horizontally.)\nThe question is asking for an action string. If I rotate it right, it becomes horizontal. If I don't move it, it will drop horizontally in the center.\n\nLet's assume the default orientation of the I_Line is vertical. To place it horizontally, I need to ROTATE_RIGHT or ROTATE_LEFT. After rotation, letting it drop in the center (NO_OP) would create a good flat base.\n\nGiven the goal of creating a flat base, a single rotation is sufficient to orient it horizontally.\n\n**Output one action string:**\nROTATE_RIGHT\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n***CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER use the words 'DROP', 'HARD_DROP', or 'SOFT_DROP' in your output, as they are invalid actions in this environment and will result in a NO_OP.***\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",

  "output": "thought: The board is completely empty, and the active piece is an `I_Line`. To create an optimal flat base for future line clears and to enable a Tetris well, the `I_Line` should be placed horizontally at the bottom of the board. This requires rotating the piece. Assuming the I-piece spawns vertically and relatively centered, a `ROTATE_RIGHT` action will change its orientation to horizontal. After rotation, it would likely span some central columns (e.g., columns 2-5 or 3-6). To create a Tetris well on the right side, the piece should be moved to the far left (e.g., occupying columns 0-3). This would involve a sequence of `LEFT` moves after the rotation. The most critical first step to achieve this is the rotation. Assuming 2 `LEFT` moves would position it effectively on the left, the full plan would be `ROTATE_RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT`. The immediate action is the first step of this plan.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left\nmove: rotate_right",

The immediate focus is on intelligently placing the first piece, the `I_Line`, to establish a favorable foundation.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:** The `I_Line` is excellent for clearing lines. With an empty board, the most effective strategy is to place it horizontally across the bottom. This creates a wide, flat base, preserving options for subsequent pieces and facilitating future Tetris setups by keeping the board low and open.\n\n**Action (derived from reflection):**\nROTATE_RIGHT (to orient it horizontally, assuming default is vertical)\nNO_OP (assuming this implies moving it to the middle or letting it drop, if further movement isn't specified, but the question only asks for reflection. If I had to give an action, it would be to move it to the center or right and drop it horizontally.)\nThe question is asking for an action string. If I rotate it right, it becomes horizontal. If I don't move it, it will drop horizontally in the center.\n\nLet's assume the default orientation of the I_Line is vertical. To place it horizontally, I need to ROTATE_RIGHT or ROTATE_LEFT. After rotation, letting it drop in the center (NO_OP) would create a good flat base.\n\nGiven the goal of creating a flat base, a single rotation is sufficient to orient it horizontally.\n\n**Output one action string:**\nROTATE_RIGHT\n\nInterpreting Game State Information:\n1. If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"board_state\", \"active_piece\", \"next_pieces_ids\", \"game_stats\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis. This comes from the Perception Module.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes:\n    - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board).\n    - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces.\n    - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\n3. If image is available, you can use it for visual context, especially if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces.\n\nTetris Game Mechanics:\n1. The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top.\n2. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row.\n3. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\n\nAvailable Actions (Numerical for reference, use string names for 'move'):\n0: no_op - Do nothing\n1: left - Move piece one cell to the left\n2: right - Move piece one cell to the right\n3: rotate_left - Rotate piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n4: rotate_right - Rotate piece 90 degrees clockwise\n\nAction Format for your response (MUST use these exact string names):\n- \"no_op\": Do nothing for this step.\n- \"left\": Move the current piece one cell to the left.\n- \"right\": Move the current piece one cell to the right.\n- \"rotate_left\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n- \"rotate_right\": Rotate the current piece 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n***CRITICAL PROHIBITION: NEVER use the words 'DROP', 'HARD_DROP', or 'SOFT_DROP' in your output, as they are invalid actions in this environment and will result in a NO_OP.***\n\nExamples of common action sequences (using numerical actions for brevity in example, you should output string names):\n- [3, 1, 1, 4] \u2192 Rotate once counter-clockwise, move right twice, then rotate once clockwise\n- [2, 2, 0, 0] \u2192 Move right twice, move left twice, then do nothing\n\nTetromino Shapes (infer from `textual_representation`): (Details omitted for brevity, refer to full shapes)\n\nGuidelines for planning:\n1. **FULL PLAN:** Determine the entire optimal sequence of moves (Rotation + Horizontal Positioning) to reach the final placement and list it in 'Placement_Plan', e.g., 'rotate_right, left, left'.\n2. **EXECUTION:** The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\n3. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** You are limited to selecting only ONE of the five listed actions (0-4) per step. Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4. Consider the next pieces in queue when planning your current move\n5. Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\n6. Aim to create complete lines and avoid creating holes.\n\nYour task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\n\nExample response (adapt based on available information):\nthought: The current T-piece needs to be rotated right to align with the gap in column 8. The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: (rotate_right, 1)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall. No rotation is necessary. The sequence is left, left. The immediate action is the first 'left' move to initiate positioning.\nPlacement_Plan: left, left\nmove: (left, 1)\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE END ---",
    "assistant": "thought: The board is completely empty, and the active piece is an `I_Line`. To create an optimal flat base for future line clears and to enable a Tetris well, the `I_Line` should be placed horizontally at the bottom of the board. This requires rotating the piece. Assuming the I-piece spawns vertically and relatively centered, a `ROTATE_RIGHT` action will change its orientation to horizontal. After rotation, it would likely span some central columns (e.g., columns 2-5 or 3-6). To create a Tetris well on the right side, the piece should be moved to the far left (e.g., occupying columns 0-3). This would involve a sequence of `LEFT` moves after the rotation. The most critical first step to achieve this is the rotation. Assuming 2 `LEFT` moves would position it effectively on the left, the full plan would be `ROTATE_RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT`. The immediate action is the first step of this plan.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left\nmove: rotate_right"
