Without previous context, the precise nature of the change cannot be determined, but the outcome is a clean slate.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With no previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed. However, achieving a completely clear board is generally the result of highly effective gameplay.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Currently, no areas require immediate attention for clearing. All columns are at height zero. Attention should be on establishing a low, flat foundation as new pieces arrive.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the clear board and an `UNKNOWN` active piece, the primary strategy is conservative build-up:\n    *   **Foundation:** Prioritize creating a flat, low-lying base to maximize future options.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** Prevent any internal gaps in the stack.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Keep the board as open as possible to accommodate various incoming pieces.\n    *   **Tetris Prep (Optional):** If an I-piece is desired for high scores, consider leaving a single column (e.g., C9) open for a vertical clear, but this is less critical than maintaining flatness initially.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, specific placements are impossible, so general good building practices are key.",
