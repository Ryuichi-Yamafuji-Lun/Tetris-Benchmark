  "output": "Reflection:\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    With no previous context provided, it's difficult to assess direct changes. However, the `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector` explicitly states that all column heights are `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates that the board is completely empty. This implies either the very start of a new game or a complete board clear (Tetris line clear that emptied the entire board, which is rare but possible). I will assume a fresh, empty board state. The extensive `Aggregate Stats` vector is unusually long and appears to contradict the empty board state if interpreted as a flattened board, but given the explicit `Column Heights Vector` summary, I prioritize the empty board interpretation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous move to evaluate, as no prior context was provided.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is entirely empty. All areas are equally important for initial placement. The primary focus is on establishing a clean, low, and flat foundation, while ideally reserving a column for future Tetris clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an `I_Line`. On an empty board, the I-piece is extremely versatile. The most common and effective initial strategy is to lay it horizontally to create a wide, flat base. This allows for easier placement of subsequent pieces and helps maintain a low overall board height. If the I-piece typically spawns vertically, rotating it is the immediate priority. Placing it roughly in the center (e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7) provides good flexibility for subsequent pieces. Alternatively, one could immediately place it vertically in a corner to establish a Tetris well, but this is often less ideal as a *first* move without knowing the next piece. Given it's the very first piece on an empty board, building a flat base is the most robust initial strategy.\n\n**Action:** ROTATE_RIGHT",
