  "output": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I can only describe the current state. The board exhibits a significant imbalance, with blocks occupying the left side and columns 4 through 9 being completely empty. Columns 0 and 1 are at height 5, while columns 2 and 3 are at height 3.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or the reasoning behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the deep well formed by the completely empty columns 4 through 9. This vast, low area needs immediate attention to prevent future pieces from becoming stuck or creating unmanageable gaps. There's also a 2-unit drop from column 1 to column 2, and a 3-unit drop from column 3 to column 4, which contribute to the board's unevenness.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current active piece is a Z-piece. The primary strategic goal should be to begin filling the empty right side of the board (columns 4-9) to create a more level playing field.\n    *   **With the Z-piece:** It could be used to start building up from column 4, or to bridge the gap from column 3 into column 4. For instance, placing it in its horizontal orientation (covering 2 cells in one column and 1 in the next, or vice versa depending on exact rotation) could start to raise the base of the empty region.\n    *   **Overall:** Prioritize building a solid, flat foundation on the right side. Avoid creating new holes or deepening existing ones on the left. The long-term aim is to achieve a flatter surface across all columns to maximize future line-clearing opportunities.",
