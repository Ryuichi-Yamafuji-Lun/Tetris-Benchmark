  "output": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I can only describe the current board state. The board currently features a descending staircase shape on the left, with column heights [4, 4, 2, 2, 2] from C0 to C4. The right side of the board (C5 to C9) is completely empty. This creates a significant height disparity and a large 'valley' or 'canyon' in the middle of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate the last move or the thought process behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the large gap created by the height difference between C1/C2 (4 down to 2) and the empty columns C5-C9. Specifically, the two-block deep hole beneath C0/C1 needs to be addressed to prevent future blocks from landing underneath and becoming inaccessible. The entire right side (C5-C9) is completely open, which is an opportunity for building but also requires careful planning to avoid creating a new unbalanced structure.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current piece is a T-Piece. The immediate priority is to use this T-Piece to address the structural issues on the left side, specifically the drop from C1 to C2.\n    *   **Option 1 (Leveling):** The T-piece could be rotated and placed to fill the gap in C2 and C3, potentially leveling out C1, C2, and C3 to a height of 3. This would reduce the height variance and make the left side more manageable.\n    *   **Option 2 (Right Side Build):** Alternatively, it could be used to start building up the empty right columns (C5-C9), but this might leave the critical gap on the left unaddressed for another turn, risking deeper holes.\n    *   **T-Spin Potential:** While the T-piece can be used for T-spins, the current board shape does not immediately present an obvious T-spin setup without further manipulation. Prioritize structural integrity first.\n    The primary goal should be to reduce the height difference between C1 and C2, and to generally work towards a flatter, more even board surface to facilitate future line clears and prevent deep holes.",
