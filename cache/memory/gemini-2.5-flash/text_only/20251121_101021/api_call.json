This setup is ideal for large line clears, particularly using I-pieces to span the entire board or a significant portion of it. Given the active piece is UNKNOWN, flexibility is key. If an I-piece appears, it should be considered for a deep drop into the well to clear multiple lines. For other pieces, focus on consolidating the left side, minimizing new holes, and maintaining the openness of the right well for future power clears. Avoid building up columns C4-C9 prematurely, as this eliminates the key line-clearing opportunity.",
