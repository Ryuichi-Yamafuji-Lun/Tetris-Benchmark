    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    The board is currently in a very initial, mostly empty state. There's a slight unevenness on the left, with column 0 at height 2, and columns 1 and 2 at height 1. The rest of the board (columns 3-9) is completely clear.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous context to evaluate the effectiveness of a last move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the slight height disparity on the left (C0:2, C1:1, C2:1). While minor, it creates a small \"dip\" that could be efficiently leveled. The vast open space on the right (C3-C9) provides excellent flexibility.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The incoming I-Line is perfect for creating a flat base or clearing lines. Given the current low and open board, the optimal strategy would be to place the I-Line horizontally. This could either level the existing small bump (e.g., placing it to raise C1, C2, C3, C4 to height 1 or 2) or extend a new flat base further to the right, keeping the board as flat and open as possible for future pieces. Avoid creating tall structures or deep wells this early in the game.",

Given the current low height, clearing lines is not immediately possible, so the goal is to build a flat base.\n\n**Possible placements for the I-Line (horizontally, default orientation):**\n*   **Placement 1: Columns 0-3 (raising C0 to 3, C1 to 2, C2 to 2, C3 to 1)**\n    *   This would make the heights: [3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   It would fill the existing dips and extend the base.\n    *   To achieve this: The I-line spawns centered, usually over columns 3-6.

Not ideal.\n\n*   **Placement 5: Vertical placement**\n    *   Rotating the I-line vertically would create a tall column, which is generally not good for keeping the board flat.

Max height 3.\n*   Placement 2 ([2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) results in an average height of 0.8. Max height 2.\nPlacement 2 leads to a lower maximum height and a flatter overall profile. It also requires fewer moves (2 LEFT vs 3 LEFT).\n\nTherefore, placing the I-Line horizontally starting at column 1 (spanning C1-C4) is the most optimal.

    "reflection": "The board currently exhibits a significant imbalance, with a flat wall of 4 blocks high across the first four columns (C0-C3) and the remaining six columns (C4-C9) completely clear. The active piece is unknown, limiting immediate tactical advice.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, it's impossible to determine how the board has changed. The current state shows a flat, 4-block high base on the left (C0-C3) and completely clear columns on the right (C4-C9).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    No previous context is available to evaluate the effectiveness of past moves.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the large, open expanse on the right side of the board (C4-C9). This represents both an opportunity and a potential challenge. The stark height difference between the left and right sides creates a distinct \"well\" in the center-right.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the current configuration, the strategy should focus on:\n    *   **Utilizing the open right side:** This is an excellent opportunity to build a clean stacking structure or a Tetris well (e.g., leaving C9 clear for I-pieces) on the right side.\n    *   **Balancing the board:** While building, aim to gradually increase the height of columns C4-C8 to reduce the height differential and create a more even playing field.\n    *   **Maintaining flatness:** On the left side (C0-C3), continue to aim for flat placements to avoid creating new holes or rough terrain, preserving the potential for future Tetris clears with I-pieces.\n    *   **Prioritize placements that fill in the right side** while keeping it clean and avoiding internal holes.",

Since I cannot know the piece, the only safe action is `NO_OP`.

This creates a large flat area on the right, which is good for stacking and creating a Tetris well. Once the piece is known, I will aim to place it on the right side (C4-C9) to start filling it up, or if it's an I-piece, potentially place it into a well if one is formed on C9.\nthought: The active piece is UNKNOWN, which means I cannot make any specific placement plans.

Critically, columns C4 through C9 are completely clear (height 0), forming a deep, wide well on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most pressing area is the large empty space spanning columns C4-C9.
