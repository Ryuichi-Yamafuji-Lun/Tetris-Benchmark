  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe most crucial piece of information, the `Active Piece`, is listed as `UNKNOWN`. This makes it impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan or determine the \"ideal actions\" because the strategy for placing a piece is entirely dependent on its shape. Without knowing the shape of the active tetromino, any specific rotation or directional movement would be a blind guess and could lead to a highly suboptimal or even game-ending placement.\n\nThe board state shows a significant imbalance with very high columns (C0-C3 at 13) and a vast empty space (C5-C9 at 0). Ideally, any piece should be used to build up the right side and flatten the board. However, without knowing the piece, I cannot determine how to achieve this.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most logical action is `NO_OP`. This choice avoids making a potentially detrimental move based on guesswork and effectively passes the turn without altering the piece's state or position, hopefully allowing the active piece to be identified in the next observation.\n\nPlacement_Plan: No specific plan can be formulated due to the unknown active piece. The safest action is to make no change.\n",

  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe active piece is unknown, which severely limits specific tactical planning. However, the board state clearly shows a dangerous height disparity: columns C0-C3 are very high, while C4 is a deep well (height 3), and C5-C9 are completely empty. The overarching strategy must be to level the board by building up the right side and reducing height on the left. Since the piece is unknown, making a specific rotation or precise placement is impossible. However, guiding *any* piece towards the right side (C4-C9) is the most beneficial general move. Moving right will shift the piece away from the dangerously high left columns and towards the empty/low columns where building is necessary. This is the most robust initial action that aligns with the strategic goal of filling the right side.\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\nno_op\n###Thought\nThe board is in a critical state with columns C0-C3 being very high. However, the active piece is explicitly stated as `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to plan any effective horizontal movement or rotation. Any action other than `NO_OP` would be a blind guess and could lead to a worse board state, especially given the high stack. Therefore, the safest and only logical action is to perform a `NO_OP` and wait for the piece to be revealed in the next observation.\nPlacement_Plan: no_op\n",

  "###Action\nrotate_right\n###Thought\nThe board is completely empty, and the active piece is an `I_Line`. To create an optimal flat base for future line clears and to enable a Tetris well, the `I_Line` should be placed horizontally at the bottom of the board. This requires rotating the piece. Assuming the I-piece spawns vertically and relatively centered, a `ROTATE_RIGHT` action will change its orientation to horizontal. After rotation, it would likely span some central columns (e.g., columns 2-5 or 3-6). To create a Tetris well on the right side, the piece should be moved to the far left (e.g., occupying columns 0-3). This would involve a sequence of `LEFT` moves after the rotation. The most critical first step to achieve this is the rotation. Assuming 2 `LEFT` moves would position it effectively on the left, the full plan would be `ROTATE_RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT`. The immediate action is the first step of this plan.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left\n"
