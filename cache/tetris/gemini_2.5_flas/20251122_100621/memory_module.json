  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe current game state shows column heights [8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means there's a very high stack on the left (C0-C2), a deep well at C3 (height 3), and columns C4-C9 are completely empty.\n\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN. This is a critical piece of information that is missing. Without knowing the active piece, it is impossible to formulate a specific, optimal placement plan. Any action I suggest will be a guess.\n\nHowever, I must still provide an action. In such a scenario where the active piece is unknown, the safest \"default\" action is usually `NO_OP`. This allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its shape in the next observation if the system is designed to update piece information on falling.\n\nAlternatively, if forced to make a \"best guess\" in a situation like this, one might consider what actions are least likely to be detrimental.\n- `LEFT` or `RIGHT`: Moving blindly could place a piece in a terrible position without knowing its shape.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`: Rotating blindly could also be disastrous, especially if the piece is already in an ideal orientation or if rotation causes a collision.\n- `NO_OP`: Allows the piece to fall, usually moving it one row down. This does not change its horizontal position or rotation, which *might* be safer if the piece is already centered and falling into a wide-open area.\n\nGiven the empty right side (C4-C9), it's highly likely that *any* piece can be placed there without immediate disaster, especially if it's falling roughly centrally. However, the exact central column is ambiguous without knowing the piece.\n\nSince the goal is to make the \"optimal next move,\" and without knowing the piece, \"optimal\" is undefined. The most cautious approach is `NO_OP` to wait for more information, *unless* there's a strong reason to believe a specific initial move (like a `LEFT` or `RIGHT` to move it towards the empty section) is generally beneficial.\n\nLooking at the board, the right side is completely open. If a piece is falling in the center (columns 4 or 5 typically), a `RIGHT` or `LEFT` could move it towards the open columns 4-9. However, even these small moves could be bad for certain piece types if they are already in a reasonable starting column.\n\nGiven the explicit instruction to avoid \"DROP\" actions, `NO_OP` is the only action that doesn't commit to a horizontal or rotational change. If the piece is falling relatively slowly, a `NO_OP` would give the system another chance to reveal the piece's type in the next observation.\n\nTherefore, `NO_OP` is the safest, least committal action when the active piece is unknown, as it prevents potentially disastrous misplacements or rotations. I'll assume the system will reveal the piece on the next observation after a `NO_OP`.\n\nIf I absolutely *had* to pick a directional move without knowing the piece, moving towards the wide open right side (C4-C9) would seem more logical than moving towards the high, uneven left side (C0-C3). A `RIGHT` move might be a slight preference if the piece starts relatively centered. But this is pure speculation. `NO_OP` is the only truly \"safe\" option under \"UNKNOWN\" piece conditions.\n\nThe prompt requires a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" in Placement_Plan. Since the piece is unknown, I cannot predict a full sequence. The only 'plan' I can make is to wait.\n\nLet's stick with `NO_OP` as the most conservative and informative-seeking action.\nPlacement_Plan: [Unknown piece, so no full plan possible. Executing NO_OP to get more information.]\n",

Any action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) would be a blind guess and could lead to a suboptimal or even game-ending placement, especially given the current board state with a deep well in column 3 and high stacks on the left. The safest and only logical action when the active piece is unknown is to do nothing (`NO_OP`) and wait for the piece to be revealed in a subsequent state.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe board has a very high left side (C0:11, C1:12, C2:12) and a deep well at C3 (height 3), with the rest of the board (C4-C9) completely empty. The active piece is UNKNOWN. This makes planning extremely difficult as I don't know the shape of the piece I'm trying to place.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, I cannot formulate a specific placement plan. Any move I make (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could be detrimental or beneficial depending entirely on the piece.\n\nGiven the critical nature of the deep well and the high stack on the left, a \"NO_OP\" is the safest move if I cannot determine the active piece. This is because any arbitrary movement or rotation without knowing the piece's shape could lead to immediately creating more holes, trapping the piece, or causing an early game over.\n\nIf I were forced to make a move, and knowing that the primary goal is often to fill holes and create flat surfaces, a RIGHT move *might* be slightly less risky if the piece is a common shape (e.g., I, O, T, S, Z, L, J) and might land in the empty columns to the right. However, even this is a pure guess.\n\nSince the prompt explicitly states \"Active Piece: UNKNOWN\", I must assume I have no information about its shape. Therefore, a \"NO_OP\" is the only logical and safe action to take. I cannot generate a \"Placement_Plan\" without knowing the piece, as any plan would be entirely speculative and likely incorrect.\n\nThus, the most optimal action is to do nothing, hoping the next observation reveals the piece.\nthought: The active piece is UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan. Making an arbitrary move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could lead to a highly suboptimal placement, creating new holes, or even topping out the board given the current high left side. The safest action when the active piece is unknown is to perform a NO_OP, hoping the piece information will be available in the next observation.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",
