Focus on the most critical step needed now (e.g., a necessary rotation or first move left/right). **Note: The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.**\n4.

The full sequence of moves would be to rotate, move right, and then move right again. The immediate critical action is the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right\nmove: rotate_right\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning]\nPlacement_Plan: [The full sequence of intended moves]\nmove: [action_name_from_list]\n\n--- RESPONSE EXAMPLE START ---\nthought: The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall.
