    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, the board is in an initial, mostly empty state. A small, low structure exists on the left, with column heights [2, 1, 1] for columns C0, C1, C2 respectively. The rest of the board (C3-C9) is completely clear.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous context, so no last move to evaluate.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The current priority is to manage the active I-Line. The existing low structure on the left (C0-C2) presents an opportunity to either flatten it or start building a new, controlled base. The large open space on the right (C3-C9) is ideal for horizontal placement of the I-Line to maintain a flat profile.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The I-Line is a powerful piece for clearing multiple lines, especially a Tetris. Given the low and relatively flat board, placing the I-Line horizontally is generally advisable to either flatten the existing small structure (e.g., across C0-C3 if possible to align, or across C1-C4) or to extend a flat base into the empty columns (e.g., C3-C6). Maintaining a flat, low board is key to avoid creating difficult-to-fill holes and to set up future line clears.",
    "response": "thought: The current board has a small, low structure on the left (C0=2, C1=1, C2=1) and a large, completely empty and flat area from C3 to C9. The active piece is an I-Line.\n\nThe optimal strategy for an I-Line, especially on a relatively empty board, is to place it horizontally to create a flat base or clear multiple lines. Placing it vertically would create a very tall spike, which is generally undesirable at the start of a game.\n\nConsidering horizontal placements:\n*   Placing it over the existing bump (e.g., C0-C3) would increase the unevenness.\n*   Placing it in the completely empty area (C3-C6, C4-C7, C5-C8, or C6-C9) would create a flat layer. The most central and ideal placement to start a flat base would be across columns C3, C4, C5, C6 at height 1. This would result in column heights [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\nIn most Tetris implementations, an unrotated I-Line piece spawns horizontally, centered on the board. For a 10-column board, this typically means it occupies columns 3, 4, 5, and 6. If this is the case, the piece is already in the optimal horizontal position and needs no rotation or horizontal movement. Allowing it to drop (via NO_OP) would place it perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to simply let the piece fall into its default, centered horizontal position.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nThere is no previous context available, so I cannot compare the current board state to any prior states. This is either the start of a new game or the first observation after a reset.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout previous context, I cannot evaluate the last move or its effectiveness.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe board currently has a highly uneven profile. Columns 0-3 are at a height of 3, while columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a \"wall\" on the left and a deep \"valley\" on the right. This significant height differential is the primary area needing attention, as it severely limits future line clear opportunities.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe immediate strategic priority is to begin flattening the board by building up columns 4-9. However, the active piece, a `Z_Piece`, is not ideal for bridging such a large height difference directly without creating a deep hole underneath it.\n\nTherefore, the strategy should be:\n*   **Avoid creating new holes:** Do not drop the `Z_Piece` into the deep valley (columns 4-9) in a way that creates an unfillable hole.\n*   **Incremental building or safe placement:** Given the `Z_Piece`'s shape, it might be best to either:\n    *   Place it on top of the existing structure (columns 0-3) to create a slightly higher, but contiguous, surface.\n    *   Carefully place it at the edge of the existing structure (e.g., spanning C3-C5) to *start* building up the right side, even if it introduces a small, manageable height difference that can be addressed by the *next* piece.\n*   **Long-term goal:** The overarching goal for future moves is to progressively raise the height of columns 4-9 to match the left side, creating a flatter surface conducive to T-spins and line clears.",
    "response": "thought:The current board has columns 0-3 at height 3 and columns 4-9 are empty. The active piece is a Z_Piece. The goal is to flatten the board and avoid creating new holes. A Z_Piece in its default horizontal orientation is difficult to place without creating roughness or deeper holes due to its offset shape, especially when bridging a large height difference.\n\nLet's analyze the best placement for the Z_Piece to minimally disrupt the board while potentially setting up for future line clears.\n\nDefault Z_Piece orientation:\n  X X\nX X\n\nRotated Z_Piece (one ROTATE_RIGHT):\n  X\nX X\nX\n\nLet's consider placing the rotated Z_Piece. If placed with its lowest blocks resting on columns 2 and 3:\n- The base of the piece will rest on height 3 for both C2 and C3.\n- The two lowest blocks of the rotated Z_Piece would land at (C2, height 3+1) and (C3, height 3+1).\n- The two upper blocks would then land at (C2, height 3+2) and (C3, height 3+2).\nThis effectively raises C2 and C3 to height 5. The resulting board heights would be [3, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This creates peaks at C2 and C3, which is not ideal for flattening.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the rotated Z_Piece's shape and placement carefully.\nRotated Z_Piece:\nX . .\nX X .\n. X .\n\nIf placed such that its bottom-leftmost block lands on C2, and the block to its right (the middle block of the 'X X' row) lands on C3:\n- The column C2 would receive the lowest 'X' (bottom-left) and the 'X' above it.\n  Height of C2: current 3 + 2 = 5.\n- The column C3 would receive the lowest 'X' (middle-right of the base) and the 'X' above it (top-right).\n  Height of C3: current 3 + 2 = 5.\nThe resulting column heights from C0 to C9 would be: [3, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This creates two peaks.\n\nAlternatively, consider the scenario where the rotated Z_Piece's blocks fall into the valley more directly, but this often creates holes. Given the large height difference, it's very difficult to place a Z_Piece without creating new holes or significantly increasing the height on one side.\n\nLet's reconsider placing the default Z_Piece (horizontal orientation) on the existing structure to minimize roughness without creating new holes.\nDefault Z_Piece:\n  X X\nX X\nIf we place the Z_Piece so that its two lower blocks (X X) land on C2 and C3, and its two upper blocks (. X X) land on C1 and C2:\n- The two bottom blocks land on C2 (height 3) and C3 (height 3). C2 becomes 3+1=4, C3 becomes 3+1=4.\n- The two top blocks land on C1 (height 3) and C2 (height 4 from previous block). C1 becomes 3+1=4, C2 becomes 4+1=5.\nResulting heights: [3, 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This creates a peak at C2 and C3.\n\nThe optimal strategy for a Z_Piece with a deep valley is usually to either place it on the existing highest terrain (to maintain a relatively flat top) or to use it to initiate a small, controlled build-up on the lower side if it doesn't create unmanageable holes.\n\nGiven the current board state [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], placing any Z_Piece without rotation into columns 0-3 will lead to unevenness.\n- Placing at C0: [4, 5, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (as calculated above) - bad.\n- Placing at C1: [3, 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - bad.\n\nWhat if we rotate the Z_Piece to its \"S-like\" orientation (rotate_left once):\n  X\nX X\n  X\n\nThis orientation is the other vertical one.

C3 becomes 4+1=5.\n- The block at (2,1) lands on C4 (height 0). C4 becomes 0+1=1.\nResulting heights: [3, 3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This also creates a peak at C3 and a hole at C4.\n\nThere seems to be no ideal placement for the Z_Piece in this specific board state without increasing roughness or creating immediate holes relative to adjacent columns. In such a scenario, the best move is often to make the least harmful move, which often means consolidating on existing height or starting a new, low structure in the valley, prioritizing flatness for the *next* piece.\n\nLet's reconsider placing the *default* Z_Piece, shifted as far right as possible *without* creating immediate holes relative to existing pieces. This means placing it within the empty columns 4-9.\nIf the default Z_Piece is placed starting at C4:\n  . X X .\n  X X . .\n- Lowest block (left side of 'X X . .') lands on C4 (height 0).

There is a tall formation on the left (columns 0-3 with heights 5, 5, 3, 3) and the entire right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty. The immediate priority is to address this deep valley and aim to create a flatter, more buildable surface across the board.

However, it can be used to start building up the empty right side, possibly by placing it horizontally to bridge the gap between column 3 and 4, or further to the right, creating a base for subsequent pieces. The goal is to avoid making the existing left wall taller or creating new holes, and to gradually build up the empty space without creating further inaccessible deep wells.",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context was provided, a direct comparison is not possible. However, the current board state shows a significant left-sided build-up. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are at heights 7, 7, and 6 respectively. Column 3 is at height 3, while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty. This indicates a very uneven board profile, with a large, open well on the right side. The extensive \"Aggregate Stats\" also provided appear to be raw telemetry, but without a key, their detailed changes or implications are unclear beyond the clear column height vector.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With no prior context or knowledge of the active piece or previous move, it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of the last action or the reasoning behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical areas needing attention are:\n    *   **Columns 0-2:** These columns are the highest and need to be flattened down.\n    *   **The \"well\" in columns 4-9:** While currently clear, this area needs to be managed strategically to allow for efficient line clears, particularly Tetrises.\n    *   **The height disparity:** The severe difference between column 3 (height 3) and column 4 (height 0) creates a significant gap that needs careful consideration when placing pieces to avoid creating unfillable holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Flatten the left:** Prioritize placing pieces in columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 to reduce their heights and create a flatter surface.\n    *   **Maintain the well:** Keep columns 4-9 as clear as possible, ideally building up column 9 one block higher than the others to create a Tetris \"well\" for future 'I' pieces.\n    *   **Avoid closing the well:** Be extremely cautious not to accidentally place blocks in columns 4-8 that would block the path for a full 'I' piece clear, especially given the current height difference from the left side.\n    *   **Prepare for 'I' piece:** Given the wide open right side, the strategy should focus on efficiently clearing the left side while setting up a perfect vertical channel in the rightmost columns for a potential Tetris.",

This is a critical piece of information that is missing. Without knowing the active piece, it is impossible to formulate a specific, optimal placement plan. Any action I suggest will be a guess.\n\nHowever, I must still provide an action. In such a scenario where the active piece is unknown, the safest \"default\" action is usually `NO_OP`. This allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its shape in the next observation if the system is designed to update piece information on falling.\n\nAlternatively, if forced to make a \"best guess\" in a situation like this, one might consider what actions are least likely to be detrimental.\n- `LEFT` or `RIGHT`: Moving blindly could place a piece in a terrible position without knowing its shape.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`: Rotating blindly could also be disastrous, especially if the piece is already in an ideal orientation or if rotation causes a collision.\n- `NO_OP`: Allows the piece to fall, usually moving it one row down. This does not change its horizontal position or rotation, which *might* be safer if the piece is already centered and falling into a wide-open area.\n\nGiven the empty right side (C4-C9), it's highly likely that *any* piece can be placed there without immediate disaster, especially if it's falling roughly centrally. However, the exact central column is ambiguous without knowing the piece.\n\nSince the goal is to make the \"optimal next move,\" and without knowing the piece, \"optimal\" is undefined. The most cautious approach is `NO_OP` to wait for more information, *unless* there's a strong reason to believe a specific initial move (like a `LEFT` or `RIGHT` to move it towards the empty section) is generally beneficial.\n\nLooking at the board, the right side is completely open. If a piece is falling in the center (columns 4 or 5 typically), a `RIGHT` or `LEFT` could move it towards the open columns 4-9. However, even these small moves could be bad for certain piece types if they are already in a reasonable starting column.\n\nGiven the explicit instruction to avoid \"DROP\" actions, `NO_OP` is the only action that doesn't commit to a horizontal or rotational change. If the piece is falling relatively slowly, a `NO_OP` would give the system another chance to reveal the piece's type in the next observation.\n\nTherefore, `NO_OP` is the safest, least committal action when the active piece is unknown, as it prevents potentially disastrous misplacements or rotations. I'll assume the system will reveal the piece on the next observation after a `NO_OP`.\n\nIf I absolutely *had* to pick a directional move without knowing the piece, moving towards the wide open right side (C4-C9) would seem more logical than moving towards the high, uneven left side (C0-C3). A `RIGHT` move might be a slight preference if the piece starts relatively centered. But this is pure speculation. `NO_OP` is the only truly \"safe\" option under \"UNKNOWN\" piece conditions.\n\nThe prompt requires a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" in Placement_Plan.

However, the current board state shows a significant imbalance. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are relatively high (10, 10, 11), while column 3 is much lower (3), creating a deep depression. The right side of the board (columns 4-9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or information on the last move, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the steep drop from column 2 (height 11) to column 3 (height 3). This large \"well\" on column 3 needs immediate attention to be filled. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are quite high and need to be brought down. The completely empty right side (columns 4-9) is currently a blank slate, offering potential for strategic building but also making the current board highly uneven.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the `Active Piece: UNKNOWN`, specific move recommendations are difficult. However, general strategy should focus on:\n    *   **Filling the C3 depression:** Prioritize pieces that can fit into column 3 to begin leveling the board.\n    *   **Reducing height on the left:** As pieces become available, aim to clear lines involving columns 0-2 to bring down their height.\n    *   **Maintaining the right side:** Keep columns 4-9 as clear as possible for now, or build them up slowly and evenly from the bottom, aiming to eventually create a flat surface for line clears.\n    *   **Avoid creating new holes:** Be cautious not to create additional holes, especially on the clean right side, while attempting to fill the existing one.\n    *   **Prioritize flattening:** The primary goal should be to reduce the height difference across the board to create more flexible placement options and increase the chances of line clears.",

The safest action when the active piece is unknown is to perform a NO_OP, hoping the piece information will be available in the next observation.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    I have no previous context to compare against. The current board state shows a significant challenge: columns 0-3 are uniformly high at 13 blocks, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This creates a large, deep \"pit\" or \"canyon\" across the right two-thirds of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context or knowledge of the last move, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The critical area is the transition from column 3 (height 13) to column 4 (height 0). This massive height difference of 13 lines needs to be carefully addressed. The entire right side (columns 4-9) is an empty void that needs to be built up. Care must be taken to not create holes when filling this space.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal is to build up columns 4-9 strategically and create a flat surface for future line clears, especially bridging the gap with the high left wall. This requires careful piece placement to avoid creating irrecoverable holes. Given the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, it's impossible to recommend an optimal immediate move, but the overall strategy must focus on raising the height of the right side uniformly while keeping potential line clears in mind. Building up column 4 is the most immediate task to connect with the existing structure.\n\nGiven the `UNKNOWN` active piece, I cannot make an informed optimal move. I will select a `NO_OP` as it's the safest option when lacking critical information to prevent potentially detrimental placements.\nNO_OP",
