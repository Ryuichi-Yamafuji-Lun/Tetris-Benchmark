    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, it's impossible to determine how the board has changed. However, the current board state is very clean and almost empty, with only the first three columns having blocks at very low heights (`[2, 1, 1]`). This suggests either a very early game state or a highly successful recent line clear (e.g., a Tetris).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, the effectiveness of the last move cannot be assessed. However, the current board configuration (low height, few blocks) implies that prior moves have kept the board relatively clean.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The current active piece is an `I_Line`, which is excellent for clearing multiple lines, especially a Tetris. The board is largely open from column 3 to 9. The current highest point is column 0 at height 2. There are no immediate deep wells suitable for a vertical I-piece Tetris. The primary area for attention is maintaining flatness and beginning to sculpt a potential Tetris well as the board fills.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the current `I_Line` and a very low, mostly empty board:\n    *   **Prioritize Flatness:** At this early stage, the goal should be to maintain a low and flat board to maximize future options and avoid early stacking issues.\n    *   **Horizontal Placement:** Placing the `I_Line` horizontally is a good option to extend the floor without creating significant height differences. For instance, placing it across columns 3-6 or 4-7 would create a flat base while leaving the left side available for future pieces to balance or build up.\n    *   **Well Preparation (Long-term):** While not immediately achievable, the `I_Line` is the prime piece for a Tetris. Future moves should aim to gradually build a 4-block deep well (e.g., in column 9 or 0) for an eventual I-piece vertical drop, but this is a multi-step process. For now, focus on establishing a solid, flat foundation.\n    *   **Avoid Early Heights:** Creating tall, isolated columns with the `I_Line` vertically in the middle of the board should be avoided unless it's for a direct line clear, as it can lead to dead space or holes.\n\n**Action Recommendation (Internal thought process leading to potential action):**\nGiven the goal of maintaining a flat, low board and the `I_Line` as the active piece, placing it horizontally is the most sensible. Placing it to extend the existing floor seems reasonable. For example, placing it across columns 3-6 would make the board `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`. Placing it further right (e.g., 6-9) `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is also good. Without a next piece, a conservative horizontal placement on the right is good to keep options open for later building.",
    "response": "thought: The board is very low and mostly empty, with the highest points at columns 0-2. The active piece is an I_Line. The optimal strategy in this early game state is to maintain a low and flat board to maximize future options and prevent early stacking issues. Placing the I_Line horizontally is the best choice to extend the floor without creating high columns or holes.\n\nAssuming the I_Line spawns horizontally in the center (e.g., covering columns 3, 4, 5, 6), placing it on the far right of the board (columns 6, 7, 8, 9) would create a new, flat section at height 1. This would result in column heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is an excellent, flat base.\n\nTo achieve this, the I_Line needs to be moved to the right three times from its assumed spawn position in columns 3-6. The first action is to move `RIGHT`.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate changes from prior states. The current board state presents a distinct pattern: columns 0-3 have a uniform height of 3, while columns 4-9 are entirely empty (height 0). This suggests either a very early game state with an initial pre-fill or the result of significant line clears that left a large open well.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, there is no \"last move\" to evaluate.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the vast unevenness of the board. The deep \"valley\" created by columns 4-9 being completely empty, compared to the wall on columns 0-3, is the primary feature. The immediate goal should be to begin filling these empty columns to create a more level playing field and set up future line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current active piece is a Z-piece.\n    *   **Leveling Strategy:** The primary strategic goal is to build up columns 4-9. The Z-piece can be effectively used to start this process.\n    *   **Z-piece Placement:** Placing the Z-piece either at the beginning of the open area (column 4) or slightly within it (column 5) would be beneficial. For example, placing it on the floor at column 4 in its default horizontal orientation would cover (C4, C5, C5, C6) (bottom of Z is C4,C5, top of Z is C5,C6), starting to raise heights in C4, C5, and C6. Placing it rotated at column 4 would create heights at C4 and C5.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** With the right side being completely empty, care must be taken to avoid creating isolated holes as we build up. Placing pieces directly on the floor is currently safe.\n    *   **Future Clears:** While no line clears are imminent, the goal is to systematically build up the right side to create a structure that allows for single, double, or even Tetris clears once the board is more balanced.",
    "response": "thought: The current board has a large well on the right side (columns 4-9 are empty). The left side (columns 0-3) is at height 3. The active piece is a Z-piece. The optimal strategy is to start filling the well from left to right, creating a relatively flat surface to avoid holes and facilitate future line clears.\n\nPlacing the Z-piece in its default horizontal orientation at column 4 would result in heights [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This creates a small peak at C5 and covers C4, C5, C6.\n\nRotating the Z-piece once (either `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` will yield the same shape for a Z-piece) makes it vertically oriented. Placing this rotated Z-piece at column 4 (meaning its leftmost block is in C4) would result in heights [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This builds up columns C4 and C5 more significantly (to heights 2 and 3 respectively) and creates a more compact, solid foundation. This is preferable as it focuses the fill on the initial columns of the well and reaches a higher point, making it easier to build upon with subsequent pieces.\n\nAssuming the Z-piece spawns centrally (e.g., leftmost block at column 3), after rotating, it would likely still have its leftmost block at column 3 or 4. To ensure its leftmost block is at column 4 after rotation, it will need a `RIGHT` move. Therefore, the full sequence of moves to achieve this optimal placement is to first `ROTATE_RIGHT`, then move `RIGHT` once. The immediate action is the rotation.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right\nmove: rotate_right",

There is no information to assess how the board has changed or the effectiveness of any past moves.\n\n**Current Board State & Areas Needing Attention:**\nThe board is drastically uneven. Columns 0 through 4 (left side) have varying heights of 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, indicating a rising structure with some slight irregularity. Crucially, columns 5 through 9 (right side) are entirely empty, presenting a pristine, open space. This vast empty area on the right is the primary focus and opportunity.\n\n**Strategic Insights:**\nThe immediate strategy should be to capitalize on the enormous empty space on the right. This setup is ideal for clearing multiple lines, especially aiming for a Tetris (4-line clear) by building a vertical well in one of the rightmost columns. Given the active piece is UNKNOWN, the most robust initial move is to transport the piece towards this open area. Maintaining a flat base in the empty columns and building up along one side (e.g., column 9) while keeping column 8 clear for an I-piece would be an excellent long-term goal. Avoid placing pieces on the left side (C0-C4) for now, as that area is already elevated and could quickly become unmanageable.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT",

Attention should be paid to not increasing their height unnecessarily and to look for opportunities to clear lines within this segment, or integrate pieces that help level out the top.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the completely empty right side (C5-C9), the primary strategy should be to funnel pieces towards this area to build up for line clears.\n\n    *   **Prioritize the Right Well:** Attempt to place pieces on the right side (C5-C9) to begin forming flat layers, ideally setting up for a Tetris clear.\n    *   **Maintain Flatness (Right):** As pieces are placed on the right, strive to keep the surface as flat as possible to maximize future line clear potential.\n    *   **Manage Left Height:** Avoid further increasing the height on the left side (C0-C1) unless it results in an immediate line clear.\n    *   **Active Piece is Key:** Since the active piece is `UNKNOWN`, specific tactics are hard to recommend. However, any long piece (like an I-piece) would be exceptionally valuable for the right side.\n\n    The current board state is highly favorable for a major line clear if the right pieces become available. The immediate focus should be on exploiting the clear columns on the right.",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As this is the first observation, there is no previous context to compare against. The current board state shows a distinct high region on the left and an entirely empty region on the right.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of the last move, it is impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **High Left Wall (C0-C2):** Columns C0, C1, and C2 have significant heights (8, 9, 8 respectively). Column C1 is currently the highest point on the board. These columns need to be brought down.\n    *   **Large Drop/Unevenness (C2-C3):** There's a dramatic 5-unit height difference between C2 (height 8) and C3 (height 3). This creates a substantial \"valley\" or \"pit\" that requires careful filling to flatten the board.\n    *   **Empty Right Side (C5-C9):** The rightmost five columns are completely empty (height 0). This presents a large, open well.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Leveling the Left:** The immediate strategic priority should be to reduce the height of the left wall (C0-C2) and level out the significant drop between C2 and C3. Pieces should ideally be placed to fill this gap and create horizontal lines for clearing.\n    *   **Utilize/Maintain the Right Well:** The 5-wide empty space on the right (C5-C9) is a significant asset. It can be used to set up a Tetris clear if an I-piece becomes available. The strategy should be to build up one of these columns (e.g., C9) while keeping a 4-wide well clear (C5-C8) for a potential I-piece. Avoid placing pieces that block this well unless absolutely necessary.\n    *   **General Flexibility (due to UNKNOWN Active Piece):** Since the active piece is unknown, all moves should aim to maintain maximum flexibility. Avoid creating new deep holes, especially under the high left wall, and try to make placements that can contribute to clearing lines on the left while preserving the right-side well.\n    *   **Focus on flat surfaces:** Long-term, the goal is to flatten the board as much as possible to increase placement options and reduce risk.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context provided, I cannot assess how the board has changed.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be evaluated.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is extremely uneven. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are quite high (10, 10, 11 units), forming a significant wall on the left. Columns 3 and 4 are much lower (3, 3 units), creating a large dip or well next to the high wall. Critically, columns 5 through 9 are completely empty (0 units), presenting a vast, open area on the right side of the board. The priority is to address the high stack on the left and level the board, especially the significant height discrepancy between column 2 and column 3.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the current state, the primary strategy should be to:\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears:** Focus on finding opportunities to clear lines, especially on the left side, to reduce the towering height.\n    *   **Utilize the Open Right:** The completely clear columns 5-9 offer excellent flexibility for placing pieces and setting up multi-line clears, particularly a Tetris (4-line clear) if an I-piece becomes available.\n    *   **Level the Board:** While clearing lines, aim to gradually level out the profound disparity between the high left side and the low middle/empty right side. Avoid creating new holes, especially in the empty columns, to maintain potential Tetris-clearing opportunities.\n    *   **Active Piece Unknown:** Since the active piece is unknown, specific tactical advice is impossible. However, the general goal is to try and fill the well formed by columns 3-4 while not exacerbating the height on the left.",

However, the current board state shows a significant disparity in column heights.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Due to the lack of previous context and an unknown active piece, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board has a very distinctive shape:\n    *   Columns C0, C1, C2 are high (11, 12, 12).\n    *   Columns C3, C4 are relatively low (3, 3), forming a sharp drop from C2.\n    *   Columns C5 through C9 are completely empty (0). This is the most striking feature.\n    This creates a large, open \"canyon\" or \"well\" on the right side of the board.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Massive Clearing Potential:** The entirely empty columns C5-C9 present an incredible opportunity for multi-line clears, especially Tetris (4-line clear). The primary strategy should revolve around leveraging this space.\n    *   **Build a Flat Base on Left:** The immediate tactical goal should be to raise columns C3 and C4 to reduce the deep well there, ideally bringing them up to a height that allows for horizontal line creation across the full board.\n    *   **Maintain the Well on Right:** While building on the left, aim to keep C9, and potentially C8, as open as possible to receive an I-piece for a Tetris clear.\n    *   **Prioritize I-pieces:** When an I-piece appears, strongly consider dropping it vertically into the rightmost open column (C9) for a quick Tetris, provided the adjacent columns can support it, or using it to clear lines in the middle if the situation on the left demands it.\n    *   **Avoid Creating New Holes:** With such a good setup for clearing, be extremely careful not to create new holes in the lower, filled sections of C0-C4 while dropping pieces.\n    *   **Look for T-spins:** If the opportunity arises while shaping the left side, don't ignore potential T-spin setups, though the primary focus should be on the large clearing opportunity on the right.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I will describe the current state. The board presents an extreme imbalance. Columns 0-3 are very high, reaching height 13. Column 4 has a piece at height 3. Columns 5-9 are completely empty. This creates a large, deep chasm on the right side of the board with a towering wall on the left.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without context on the last move or active piece, it's difficult to assess effectiveness directly. However, the current board state (a near-filled left side and completely empty right) is highly inefficient and dangerous. It suggests either an ongoing, highly specialized (and risky) strategy to clear multiple lines on the left or a series of suboptimal placements that led to this extreme height disparity.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C3):** Critically high. Requires immediate attention to clear lines and prevent topping out.\n    *   **Right Side (C5-C9):** Completely empty. This vast open space needs to be built up strategically, either to create future line clear opportunities or to facilitate shifting pieces from the left.\n    *   **Mid-board Transition (C4-C5):** The abrupt drop from height 3 (C4) to 0 (C5) creates a significant horizontal challenge for most pieces.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Leveling:** The primary strategic goal must be to reduce the height disparity. This involves clearing lines on the left while simultaneously building up the right side.\n    *   **Utilize the Open Space:** The empty right side is both a challenge and an opportunity. If an I-piece becomes available, it could be used to quickly fill multiple empty columns.\n    *   **Avoid Traps:** Be extremely cautious with pieces that might get stuck on top of the left wall, leading to a game over.\n    *   **Anticipate Next Piece:** Without knowing the active piece, specific placements are impossible. However, the general strategy should be to keep the overall height down and prepare for potential line clears across the entire width.\n\nThe current state is precarious, demanding careful piece placement to avoid a quick game over and work towards re-balancing the board.",
    "response": "thought: The active piece is explicitly listed as UNKNOWN. This makes it impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan, as the shape and orientation of the piece are critical to determining its best placement. Given the extreme imbalance of the board, with columns 0-3 being very high (13 units) and columns 5-9 completely empty, the general strategy should be to avoid further exacerbating the height on the left and ideally move towards the empty right side to start building it up or to find a drop zone.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, any rotational action is a shot in the dark. Moving `LEFT` would move the piece further into the already high left section, which is generally undesirable. `NO_OP` would simply drop the piece from its unknown spawn location, which could place it poorly on the high left. Moving `RIGHT` is the most prudent general action as it shifts the piece away from the critical left wall and towards the expansive empty space on the right, where it might find a place to land without immediate danger, or begin filling the well. Since I cannot predict further actions without knowing the piece, the `Placement_Plan` will consist only of this exploratory move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context to compare against. The current board presents a striking configuration: a high, somewhat uneven wall on the left (C0-C3, heights 13-15), a significant drop to a lower column (C4, height 3), and a completely empty right side of the board (C5-C9, all height 0).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, the effectiveness of any previous move cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the gaping well formed by columns C5-C9 being completely empty, coupled with the height difference from C4 (height 3). This needs to be built up urgently to avoid creating unfillable holes as the left side inevitably grows. The high wall on the left (C0-C3) also requires management to prevent a game over, but the immediate priority is addressing the right-side void.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to aggressively fill the large well on the right. Wide pieces, especially I-blocks, S/Z, L/J, or T-blocks placed horizontally, should be prioritized to quickly raise the height of columns C5-C9. While doing so, attempt to gradually level the board by building up C4 and the right side without creating new internal holes on the left. Given the active piece is UNKNOWN, the strategy must remain adaptable to whatever piece is next.",

This creates a large, critical well on the right side of the board that must be filled to avoid game over and to clear lines efficiently.\n\nThe active piece is listed as \"UNKNOWN.\" This means I cannot precisely predict the outcome of rotations or specific horizontal movements as I don't know the piece's shape. The \"Aggregate Stats\" list is long and complex, and without explicit mapping of which block of stats corresponds to which action or piece type, it is not directly actionable for determining the \"optimal\" move for an \"UNKNOWN\" piece.\n\nGiven these constraints, I must choose the best *heuristic* initial action based on the general board state.\n1.  **Avoid stacking higher on the left:** Moving the piece to the `LEFT` would place it on top of the already high columns (C0-C3), which is undesirable.\n2.  **Address the right-side void:** The most critical problem is the deep well on the right (C4-C9). To begin filling this area, the incoming piece needs to be moved towards the right side of the board.\n3.  **Rotations are risky:** Performing a `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` is a gamble without knowing the piece's shape, as it could orient the piece into an unhelpful or even detrimental configuration.\n4.  **NO_OP is passive:** A `NO_OP` would allow the piece to fall from its current, unknown central spawn position. This might lead it to drop awkwardly into the C4 well or on the left side, exacerbating existing problems or creating new holes.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and proactively beneficial first move, given an unknown piece and the current board layout, is to move the piece `RIGHT`.

Columns C0, C1, C2, and C3 are very high (17, 17, 15, 13 respectively), indicating an imminent threat of topping out on the left side. Columns C5 through C9 are completely empty, creating a massive well or valley. Column C4 is relatively low at height 3, acting as a bridge to the empty right side. The critical area of attention is the sheer height on the left and the desperate need to either clear lines there or build up the right side to prevent the game from ending.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The top priority is to flatten the board. We must avoid placing any more pieces that further increase the height of C0-C3 without clearing lines. Future moves should aim to:\n    *   **Reduce height on the left:** Look for opportunities to clear lines, especially on columns C0-C3.\n    *   **Build up the right:** Strategically place pieces on C4 and C5-C9 to begin filling the large empty space and reduce the extreme height difference.\n    *   **Bridge the gap:** Use appropriate pieces to transition from the height of C3 (13) down to C4 (3) and then across the empty C5-C9. This will create a more playable surface for future line clears.\n    *   The `UNKNOWN` active piece is a major handicap. Without knowing the next piece, specific tactical advice is impossible, but the overarching strategy must be to address the severe height imbalance immediately.",
    "response": "thought: The active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes precise planning impossible. However, the board state is highly imbalanced: the left side (columns C0-C3, heights 17, 17, 15, 13) is dangerously high, while the right side (columns C5-C9) is completely empty, with C4 being very low (height 3). Without knowing the piece, the safest and most strategic blind move is to try and move the piece away from the high left side and towards the empty right side to start filling the well. Any rotation would be purely speculative. Moving right increases the chances of the piece landing in the empty columns or on C4, which is less risky than adding to the already high left columns. My plan is to move the piece as far right as possible to begin building up the right side. The immediate action is the first 'right' move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right\nmove: right",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context provided, I cannot assess how the board has changed from prior states. This reflection is based solely on the current observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the previous move or the rationale behind it, I cannot evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a critical state. Columns C0, C1, and C2 are dangerously high at 19, 19, and 18, respectively, indicating imminent game over if lines are not cleared. Column C3 is also high at 13. There's a significant height differential, with C4 at 3 and columns C5-C9 completely empty. The primary concern is the extreme height on the left side (C0-C2) and the vast open space on the right (C5-C9), creating an extremely uneven and challenging landscape.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Survival is the immediate priority. The strategy must revolve around:\n    *   **Aggressive Line Clearing:** Focus all efforts on clearing lines, especially from the high left side (C0-C3), to reduce the board height and avoid topping out.\n    *   **Leveling the Board (Long-Term):** While critical line clears take precedence, the ultimate goal should be to gradually build up the empty right side (C5-C9) to create a more manageable, level surface. However, this must not come at the cost of immediate survival on the left.\n    *   **Careful Piece Placement:** Avoid creating new holes or exacerbating the height difference. Given the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, flexibility and adaptability will be key. Each piece must be placed to contribute to a line clear or to fill the vast gap on the right in a controlled manner.",
    "response": "thought: The board is in a critical state, with columns C0, C1, and C2 at height 19, 19, and 18 respectively, which is dangerously close to the top. Column C3 is at 13, while columns C5-C9 are completely empty. The active piece is explicitly stated as UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan involving rotations or horizontal movements. Any arbitrary move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could lead to an immediate game over if the piece is tall and lands on an already high column, or could create unfillable holes. The safest action in this scenario, given the lack of information about the active piece and the precarious board state, is to do nothing (`NO_OP`). This allows the piece to fall one step, which will hopefully reveal its shape and current position relative to the board, enabling a strategic decision in the next turn.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    With no previous context provided, it's difficult to assess direct changes. However, the `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector` explicitly states that all column heights are `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates that the board is completely empty. This implies either the very start of a new game or a complete board clear (Tetris line clear that emptied the entire board, which is rare but possible). I will assume a fresh, empty board state. The extensive `Aggregate Stats` vector is unusually long and appears to contradict the empty board state if interpreted as a flattened board, but given the explicit `Column Heights Vector` summary, I prioritize the empty board interpretation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous move to evaluate, as no prior context was provided.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is entirely empty. All areas are equally important for initial placement. The primary focus is on establishing a clean, low, and flat foundation, while ideally reserving a column for future Tetris clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an `I_Line`. On an empty board, the I-piece is extremely versatile. The most common and effective initial strategy is to lay it horizontally to create a wide, flat base. This allows for easier placement of subsequent pieces and helps maintain a low overall board height. If the I-piece typically spawns vertically, rotating it is the immediate priority. Placing it roughly in the center (e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7) provides good flexibility for subsequent pieces. Alternatively, one could immediately place it vertically in a corner to establish a Tetris well, but this is often less ideal as a *first* move without knowing the next piece. Given it's the very first piece on an empty board, building a flat base is the most robust initial strategy.\n\n**Action:** ROTATE_RIGHT",
    "response": "thought: The board is completely empty, as indicated by all column heights being zero. The active piece is an I_Line. To create a flat base, which is generally the optimal strategy for the first piece on an empty board, the I-piece needs to be rotated from its default vertical orientation to horizontal. Either `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` would achieve this. I will choose `ROTATE_RIGHT`. After rotation, I would ideally center the piece (e.g., move it to place its leftmost block in column 3 for a 4-block wide piece) to provide maximum flexibility for subsequent pieces. However, the current action is just the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left\nmove: rotate_right",
