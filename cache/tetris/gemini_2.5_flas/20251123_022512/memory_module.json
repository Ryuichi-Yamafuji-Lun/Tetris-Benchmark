  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe active piece is explicitly listed as UNKNOWN. This makes it impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan, as the shape and orientation of the piece are critical to determining its best placement. Given the extreme imbalance of the board, with columns 0-3 being very high (13 units) and columns 5-9 completely empty, the general strategy should be to avoid further exacerbating the height on the left and ideally move towards the empty right side to start building it up or to find a drop zone.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, any rotational action is a shot in the dark. Moving `LEFT` would move the piece further into the already high left section, which is generally undesirable. `NO_OP` would simply drop the piece from its unknown spawn location, which could place it poorly on the high left. Moving `RIGHT` is the most prudent general action as it shifts the piece away from the critical left wall and towards the expansive empty space on the right, where it might find a place to land without immediate danger, or begin filling the well. Since I cannot predict further actions without knowing the piece, the `Placement_Plan` will consist only of this exploratory move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe current board state is severely uneven. Columns C0-C3 are high (heights 14, 15, 15, 13), C4 is very low (height 3), and columns C5-C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a large, critical well on the right side of the board that must be filled to avoid game over and to clear lines efficiently.\n\nThe active piece is listed as \"UNKNOWN.\" This means I cannot precisely predict the outcome of rotations or specific horizontal movements as I don't know the piece's shape. The \"Aggregate Stats\" list is long and complex, and without explicit mapping of which block of stats corresponds to which action or piece type, it is not directly actionable for determining the \"optimal\" move for an \"UNKNOWN\" piece.\n\nGiven these constraints, I must choose the best *heuristic* initial action based on the general board state.\n1.  **Avoid stacking higher on the left:** Moving the piece to the `LEFT` would place it on top of the already high columns (C0-C3), which is undesirable.\n2.  **Address the right-side void:** The most critical problem is the deep well on the right (C4-C9). To begin filling this area, the incoming piece needs to be moved towards the right side of the board.\n3.  **Rotations are risky:** Performing a `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` is a gamble without knowing the piece's shape, as it could orient the piece into an unhelpful or even detrimental configuration.\n4.  **NO_OP is passive:** A `NO_OP` would allow the piece to fall from its current, unknown central spawn position. This might lead it to drop awkwardly into the C4 well or on the left side, exacerbating existing problems or creating new holes.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and proactively beneficial first move, given an unknown piece and the current board layout, is to move the piece `RIGHT`. This action aims to guide the piece towards the lowest and most critical area of the board, initiating the process of leveling the surface. Since the piece is unknown, I cannot plan beyond this initial heuristic move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes precise planning impossible. However, the board state is highly imbalanced: the left side (columns C0-C3, heights 17, 17, 15, 13) is dangerously high, while the right side (columns C5-C9) is completely empty, with C4 being very low (height 3). Without knowing the piece, the safest and most strategic blind move is to try and move the piece away from the high left side and towards the empty right side to start filling the well. Any rotation would be purely speculative. Moving right increases the chances of the piece landing in the empty columns or on C4, which is less risky than adding to the already high left columns. My plan is to move the piece as far right as possible to begin building up the right side. The immediate action is the first 'right' move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe board is in a critical state, with columns C0, C1, and C2 at height 19, 19, and 18 respectively, which is dangerously close to the top. Column C3 is at 13, while columns C5-C9 are completely empty. The active piece is explicitly stated as UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan involving rotations or horizontal movements. Any arbitrary move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could lead to an immediate game over if the piece is tall and lands on an already high column, or could create unfillable holes. The safest action in this scenario, given the lack of information about the active piece and the precarious board state, is to do nothing (`NO_OP`). This allows the piece to fall one step, which will hopefully reveal its shape and current position relative to the board, enabling a strategic decision in the next turn.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nrotate_right\n###Thought\nThe board is completely empty, as indicated by all column heights being zero. The active piece is an I_Line. To create a flat base, which is generally the optimal strategy for the first piece on an empty board, the I-piece needs to be rotated from its default vertical orientation to horizontal. Either `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` would achieve this. I will choose `ROTATE_RIGHT`. After rotation, I would ideally center the piece (e.g., move it to place its leftmost block in column 3 for a 4-block wide piece) to provide maximum flexibility for subsequent pieces. However, the current action is just the rotation.\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left\n"
