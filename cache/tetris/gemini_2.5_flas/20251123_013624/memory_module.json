This gives more lateral space for potential future adjustments once the piece type is revealed. Rotating or moving left would be riskier without knowing the piece. Therefore, the immediate action is to move the piece one step to the right. As I cannot predict further actions for an unknown piece, the plan is a single right move.\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes it impossible to formulate a strategic placement plan involving rotations or specific horizontal movements. The board state shows columns C0, C1, C2 at height 19, and C3 at height 13, while columns C4-C9 are completely empty. Typically, pieces spawn in the upper-middle of the board (around columns C4-C5).\n\nSince I do not know the piece's shape, I cannot make an informed decision about rotating or moving it. Arbitrarily moving LEFT or ROTATING could lead to the unknown piece landing in a critical high spot on the left side (C0-C3) or creating an undesirable block. Moving RIGHT without knowing the piece's shape or current position is also a gamble.\n\nThe safest course of action, given the UNKNOWN active piece and the standard piece spawn location (which is usually over the empty columns), is to perform a NO_OP. This allows the piece to fall naturally from its spawn point, which is most likely over the empty C4-C9 region, where it will cause the least immediate harm and hopefully give me information about its shape in the next turn.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe board is completely empty, and the active piece is an I_Line. The I-piece typically spawns horizontally. The most optimal first move on an empty board with an I-piece is to place it horizontally at the bottom to create a flat, wide foundation. This leaves columns 3, 4, 5, and 6 filled by the I-piece, and the rest empty. No rotation or horizontal movement is needed for this optimal initial placement. Therefore, the immediate action is to do nothing and let it drop.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n"
