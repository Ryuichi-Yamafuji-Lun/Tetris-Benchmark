    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As this is the initial observation, there is no previous state to compare against. The board is currently very low and mostly empty, with height only present in the first three columns (C0: 2, C1: 1, C2: 1), and the remaining columns (C3-C9) are completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, it's not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of any past move. However, the current state of a nearly empty and very low board is highly favorable, suggesting a clean start or effective previous clears.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is largely open and clean. The main area needing attention is to establish a flat, wide base for future pieces. There's a minor height difference on the far left (C0=2, C1=1, C2=1), but the ample empty space provides flexibility.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is the I-line. Given the current board state (very low and mostly empty), the most effective strategy is to place the I-line horizontally to create a flat, wide foundation. Placing it towards the right side of the board (e.g., in columns C3-C6 or further right) would be ideal to maximize the flat surface, providing a stable platform for subsequent pieces and allowing for a clean build towards potential Tetrises without immediately engaging the minor irregularity on the far left. Maintaining a low and flat profile is key.\n\n**NO_OP**",
    "response": "thought: The board is mostly empty with a low height profile [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I-Line. The optimal strategy is to place the I-line horizontally to create a flat, low base, ideally spanning columns C3-C6. This utilizes the wide empty space and avoids interacting with the small bump on the left side of the board.\n\nAssuming the I-line spawns in its common horizontal orientation, but slightly off-center (e.g., spanning columns C2,C3,C4,C5), a single `RIGHT` move would position it optimally over columns C3,C4,C5,C6. If it spawned perfectly in C3-C6, `NO_OP` would be sufficient, but it's more common to need a minor adjustment. If it spawned in C4-C7, a `LEFT` move would be needed. Choosing `RIGHT` is a reasonable first move to push it towards the right side of the board for better alignment with the large empty space. If the I-line were to spawn vertically, `ROTATE_RIGHT` (or `ROTATE_LEFT`) would be the first critical move, but horizontal spawn is usually the default.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context was provided, it's impossible to determine how the board has changed. We are evaluating the current state in isolation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or a recorded last move, an assessment of its effectiveness cannot be made.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board currently features a significant vertical discontinuity: columns 0-3 are at a height of 3, while columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). The primary area needing attention is the large 'well' spanning columns 4-9. The immediate goal is to start building up these empty columns to create a flatter, more manageable surface across the board.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is a `Z_Piece`. Given its shape (`XX` over ` XX` or rotated), it's best suited for filling horizontal gaps or creating staggered platforms. To address the current board state (`[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), the most effective use of the Z-piece would be to place it horizontally to bridge the gap between the existing stack (column 3) and the empty space (column 4). This would involve placing its lowest-left block over column 3, extending into columns 4 and 5. This placement would start building up columns 4 and 5, reducing the severe height difference and creating a foundation for future pieces to flatten the board. Avoid placing the Z-piece on the already built-up left side, as this would deepen the well on the right.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\nThe current board has a major height discrepancy between columns 0-3 (height 3) and columns 4-9 (height 0). The active `Z_Piece` is ideal for bridging such gaps when oriented horizontally. By moving the `Z_Piece` to the right, we aim to place its leftmost bottom block on column 3, with the rest of the piece extending into columns 4 and 5. This action (`RIGHT`) directly addresses the need to start building up the empty right side of the board and flatten the surface, which is a critical long-term strategy for Tetris. Assuming the `Z_Piece` spawns somewhat to the left, a single `RIGHT` move should position it favorably to achieve this bridging.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT",
    "response": "thought: The current board state shows a significant discrepancy in column heights: columns 0-3 are at height 3, while columns 4-9 are completely empty.

A single `RIGHT` action will move the piece into the desired position.\n\nOther options:\n- `NO_OP`: The piece would drop with its leftmost block around column 3, falling partially onto the existing stack and partially into the well.

For example, a vertical Z_Piece (2 wide) placed at column 3 would create a height spike at columns 3 and 4, which is worse than the current plan.\n\nTherefore, moving `RIGHT` once is the optimal first step.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

    "response": "thought: The board has a significant imbalance: columns 0-3 have heights [5, 5, 3, 3], while columns 4-9 are all at height 0. The active piece is a Z_Piece.\n\nThe Z_Piece has two common orientations:\n1. Horizontal: Two blocks on top, two blocks below, offset (e.g., `##\\n ##`).\n2. Vertical: Two blocks stacked, two blocks stacked, offset (e.g., `# \\n##\\n# ` or rotated ` #\\n##\\n#`). For a Z-piece this is usually like `## \\n  ##` (horizontal, default) or ` #\\n##\\n# ` (vertical).\n\nLet's consider the default orientation of the Z_Piece (horizontal: `XX\\n XX` where X are the blocks) and its rotated orientation (vertical: ` X\\nXX\\nX`).\n\nGiven the current board state, the priority is to start filling the large empty area on the right (columns 4-9).\nPlacing the Z_Piece in its default (horizontal) orientation:\n- If placed starting at C0: Heights become [5, 6, 4, 3, 0, ...] - makes C1 higher, creates a hole under C1. Bad.\n- If placed starting at C1: Heights become [5, 6, 5, 3, 0, ...] - makes C2 higher.\n- If placed starting at C2: Heights become [5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 0, ...] - makes C3 higher.\n- If placed starting at C3: Heights become [5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 0, ...] - makes C3, C4 higher.\n- If placed starting at C4: Heights become [5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 0, ...] - This starts building the right side.\n- If placed starting at C5: Heights become [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0, ...] - This also starts building the right side.\n\nLet's evaluate placing the Z_Piece in its rotated (vertical) orientation: ` X\\nXX\\nX` (top to bottom).\n- This shape generally makes a 2-unit wide structure with a height of 3.\n- If rotated right (becomes ` X\\nXX\\nX`), it takes up 3 vertical units.\n- If placed starting at C3, C4, C5 (columns for the piece): This could potentially help fill the C3/C4 gap.\n  - Rotated and placed in C3, C4: Heights could become [5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 0, ...]\n    - Z-piece vertical, occupies columns C3 and C4: Top of C3,C4 would be at height 3, height 3. The lowest block of the piece would be at height 0.\n    - Resulting heights: C3, C4 would have their heights increase to 3. This doesn't seem right for a Z piece. A Z piece is 2x3 or 3x2.\n    - If it's ` #\\n##\\n# `, it would cover 2 columns. For example, if placed at C3, it would affect C3 and C4.\n      - Blocks would be at: (C3, 0), (C3, 1), (C4, 1), (C4, 2). The highest point would be at C4, height 2.\n      - New heights: C0:5, C1:5, C2:3, C3:2, C4:3, C5:0,...\n      - This creates a small gap in C3 compared to C4 and doesn't fill the void effectively.\n\nThe most beneficial immediate move is to start shifting the Z_Piece to the right to fill the large void.\nThe Z_Piece in its default orientation (`XX\\n XX`) would be a 2x3 shape (width 3, height 2).\nIf it lands at (C4, C5, C6) as its base, it covers C4 at height 0 and C5 at height 0, and C6 at height 1 (because of the offset).\nSpecifically, it would occupy (C4,0), (C5,0), (C5,1), (C6,1). The maximum height would increase to 2 at C5 and C6. This is a good start.\n\nLet's assume the Z_Piece spawns at a standard position, typically centered at the top. This means it might cover columns 3, 4, 5 by default.\nThe piece is `##` on top of ` ##`.\nIf it starts at column 3, then it occupies (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1).\nIts current central position is likely around columns 4 and 5.\n\nTo place the horizontal Z-piece at the far right, e.g., covering C7, C8, C9:\n- It would sit at C7 height 0, C8 height 0, and C9 height 1.\n- This would result in heights like: [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2] (relative to the base level).\n- This fills a portion of the right side, which is the primary goal.\n\nTo move the Z-piece to the rightmost possible position, it needs multiple `RIGHT` moves.\nThe board is 10 columns wide. The piece width is 3 (horizontal) or 2 (vertical).\n- Horizontal Z-piece (`XX\\n XX`): Occupies 3 columns.\n  - Default spawn typically allows it to span from C3 to C5.\n  - Max right position would be C7 to C9.\n  - If it starts at C3, needs to move RIGHT 4 times (C3->C4, C4->C5, C5->C6, C6->C7).\n- Vertical Z-piece (` X\\nXX\\nX`): Occupies 2 columns.\n  - Default spawn typically allows it to span from C4 to C5.\n  - Max right position would be C8 to C9.\n  - This would mean it covers C8 at height 0 and C9 at height 1. Heights could be [..., 0, 0, 0, 2, 3] or similar.\n\nComparing these options:\n1. Horizontal Z-piece to C7-C9: New board heights would be [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. (Assuming the Z-piece adds 2 to C8 and C9, with C7 remaining 0 or 1 depending on how it's defined). This looks like a better spread. It creates a flat base of height 2 across columns 8 and 9.\n2. Vertical Z-piece to C8-C9: New board heights would be [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3] if it's placed there. This would create a height difference of 1 on the rightmost edge, and leave C7 empty.\n\nThe horizontal Z-piece covering C7, C8, C9 (effectively ` C7:0, C8:2, C9:2` or similar with its internal structure) seems slightly better for creating a flatter base, even if it leaves C4-C7 empty initially. The main goal is to build up the right.\n\nThe plan should be to move the piece right as far as possible without rotating, then drop it.\nLet's assume the Z-piece spawns near the center (columns 3, 4, 5).\nTo move it to columns 7, 8, 9, it needs 4 `RIGHT` moves.\nThe immediate action is to move `RIGHT`.\nthought: The board is heavily imbalanced, with columns 0-3 having heights [5, 5, 3, 3] and columns 4-9 being completely empty. The active piece is a Z_Piece.\n\nThe most critical task is to start filling the large void on the right side of the board (columns 4-9) to prevent creating deeper holes and to build a more balanced structure.\n\nThe Z_Piece, in its default horizontal orientation (`XX\\n XX`), can be placed to create a base. If moved to the far right, it could span columns 7, 8, and 9. Placing it such that its lowest blocks are at height 0 in columns 8 and 9, would result in new heights of [..., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2] for the right side (from C4 onwards). This helps to start building up the empty space.\n\nAssuming the Z_Piece spawns centered, it would likely be over columns 3-5 or 4-6. To move it to occupy columns 7-9, it will require multiple `RIGHT` movements. Since I can only execute one action per turn, the first step is to move the piece to the right.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, right\nmove: right",

If moved to the far right, it could span columns 7, 8, and 9. Placing it such that its lowest blocks are at height 0 in columns 8 and 9, would result in new heights of [..., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2] for the right side (from C4 onwards). This helps to start building up the empty space.\n\nAssuming the Z_Piece spawns centered, it would likely be over columns 3-5 or 4-6. To move it to occupy columns 7-9, it will require multiple `RIGHT` movements. Since I can only execute one action per turn, the first step is to move the piece to the right.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, right",

This needs immediate attention to prevent future piece placements from falling into it and creating unfillable holes.\n    *   The entire right side of the board (columns C4-C9) is completely empty. This presents a large, flat area to build upon but also requires careful planning to avoid creating new isolated holes.\n    *   The left side (C0-C2) is approaching critical height and needs to be managed carefully, potentially by clearing lines if possible without exacerbating the well.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The top priority is to level out the board. Focus on using incoming pieces to:\n    *   Fill the large discrepancy between C2 and C3.\n    *   Start building up the completely empty columns C4-C9 in a flat and contiguous manner.\n    *   Given the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, general strategy dictates finding placements that incrementally raise the lower sections of the board while avoiding the creation of new holes, especially within the deep trench.

Columns 0-3 are filled to a height of 13, making the left side dangerously high and close to topping out. Columns 4-9 are completely empty. This creates a deep and wide trench/gap between column 3 and column 4 that needs to be managed. The primary attention should be on either clearing lines from the high left side or carefully building up the empty right side without exacerbating the existing height disparity or creating inaccessible holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize line clears:** The board is very high on the left. Clearing lines, especially from columns 0-3, is critical to prevent a game over.\n    *   **Level the playing field:** Focus on either bringing down the height of columns 0-3 or building up columns 4-9 to reduce the extreme height difference.\n    *   **Utilize empty space cautiously:** The empty right side offers flexibility, but avoid simply mirroring the left side's high stack. Try to build in a way that allows for efficient line clears or sets up future combos.\n    *   **Active piece unknown:** Without knowing the active piece, the general strategy must remain flexible. Each piece should be evaluated for its potential to clear lines on the left, bridge the gap, or contribute to a balanced build on the right. Avoid deepening the trench or creating new holes under the high left wall.",
    "response": "thought: The active piece is UNKNOWN. With such a critically high left side of the board (columns 0-3 at height 13) and an empty right side (columns 4-9 at height 0), making any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) without knowing the piece shape is extremely risky. It could lead to an immediate game over if the piece is tall and lands on the left, or it could create an unrecoverable hole/stack on the right. The safest and most logical action is to perform a NO_OP, allowing the piece to drop one step, in hopes that its type will be revealed in the next observation.

Columns 0-3 are very high (heights ranging from 13 to 15), approaching the top of the playfield. Columns 4-9 are completely empty. This significant height difference on the left side is the primary area requiring attention, as continued build-up there will quickly lead to a game over. The empty right side presents both an opportunity to build cleanly but also a challenge due to the lack of existing structure.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the current state, the primary strategic goal should be to reduce the height on the left side (columns 0-3) to prevent topping out. This means prioritizing line clears. Simultaneously, consider how to start building up the right side (columns 4-9) to create a more balanced board and future clearing opportunities. Depending on the active piece (which is currently unknown), a decision needs to be made whether to focus on clearing lines on the left or starting a new foundation on the right. If an 'I' piece comes, the open right well could be ideal for a Tetris, but caution is needed not to make the left unmanageable while waiting.",

Conversely, columns C4-C9 are completely empty.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Cannot be assessed as no previous context was provided.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot be assessed as no previous context was provided.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The immediate priority is to address the high stack on the left (C0-C3) by clearing lines. This region is a major risk for topping out. The vast empty space on the right (C4-C9) also needs attention; it represents both an opportunity for line clears and a potential hazard if pieces are dropped carelessly, creating a massive, unfillable well.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The overarching strategy must be to reduce the height of the left side. This means prioritizing pieces that can clear lines, especially Tetris clears, on the left. The empty right side should be built up cautiously, aiming for a flat surface to eventually support Tetris clears or at least minimize height differences. Avoid creating new holes on the left and be wary of dropping pieces on the right that would create an isolated deep well.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\nThe \"Active Piece: UNKNOWN\" makes tactical decision-making for the immediate move extremely challenging. Without knowing the shape of the falling piece, it's impossible to determine the optimal placement for line clearing, hole filling, or maintaining flatness. However, an action must be chosen. Given the board's severe lean towards the left, the safest general heuristic for an unknown piece is to move it away from the immediate danger zone (the high left stack) and towards the most open area, which is the right side. This maximizes potential options for placement once the piece type is known, or minimizes the immediate risk of adding to the critical height on the left if the piece were to drop from its initial spawn position.\n\n**Action:** RIGHT",

However, the board is severely imbalanced, with columns C0-C3 being very high (13-17) and columns C4-C9 being completely empty (0). To maximize options and avoid immediately contributing to the high stack on the left, the most logical first move is to shift the unknown piece towards the empty right side. This gives more lateral space for potential future adjustments once the piece type is revealed. Rotating or moving left would be riskier without knowing the piece. Therefore, the immediate action is to move the piece one step to the right. As I cannot predict further actions for an unknown piece, the plan is a single right move.\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

The board is completely empty, as confirmed by the `Column Heights Vector` being all zeros.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    N/A, as no moves have been made yet in this game session.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The entire board is pristine and open. Attention is solely on the active `I_Line` piece and planning its optimal initial placement.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    As the first piece, the `I_Line` offers excellent potential for clearing lines. On an empty board, a common strategy is to place it horizontally at the bottom to create a wide, flat foundation. This setup provides maximum flexibility for subsequent pieces and avoids creating early holes or unevenness. Another option could be to immediately set up a vertical well for a future Tetris, but a flat base is generally more forgiving for the initial few pieces.\n\n**Action:**\nNO_OP",
