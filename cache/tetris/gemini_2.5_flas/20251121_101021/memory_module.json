The rest of the board (C4-C9) is completely empty. The active piece is UNKNOWN.\n\nGiven an UNKNOWN active piece, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to move the piece towards the large empty area on the right. This provides maximum flexibility for future rotations and horizontal adjustments once the piece type is revealed. Placing the piece immediately over the tall left stack or the deep well without knowing its shape risks creating further complications or blocking potential line clears. Moving right buys time and space.\n\nTherefore, the first action should be to move the piece to the right. This initiates the movement away from the congested left side and towards the open, flexible area. Subsequent moves will depend on the revealed piece type and its optimal placement within the right-side expanse or for addressing the C3 well.\nthought: The board has a high stack on the left (columns C0-C2: 8, 9, 8) with a deep well at C3 (height 3). The entire right side of the board (C4-C9) is completely empty. The active piece is UNKNOWN. With an unknown piece, the best strategy is to maximize options and space. Moving the piece to the right, away from the immediate hazards of the high stack and deep well, provides the most flexibility when the piece's shape is revealed. It allows for more potential rotations and horizontal adjustments without risking an immediate problematic placement on the congested left side. Therefore, the first step is to move right to utilize the open space.\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

The most logical and safe action is to perform a `NO_OP` (do nothing) to allow the game to progress and reveal the active piece in the next state. Once the piece is known, I can then plan to fill the large gap on the right side of the board (columns C4-C9) or attempt to clear lines on the left.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\n(no_op, 1)\n###Thought\nThe current game state indicates that the active piece is UNKNOWN. This means I cannot plan a specific placement. Without knowing the active piece, any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) would be a guess and potentially detrimental. The only safe action when the piece is unknown is NO_OP, as it pauses the piece's descent for a moment, hopefully allowing the next observation to reveal the piece.\n\nThe board has a very uneven height, with columns C0-C3 being high and C4-C9 being completely empty. My strategic goal is to fill the right side, but this is impossible without knowing the piece.\nTherefore, the most optimal action here is to do nothing and wait for the piece to be revealed in the next observation.\nthought: The active piece is UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to plan an optimal placement or even a safe move. Any movement or rotation could lead to a disadvantageous position or create unwanted holes. The only logical and safe action when the active piece is unknown is to perform a NO_OP, hoping the piece will be revealed in the subsequent observation, allowing for informed decision-making. The board has a large gap on the right, but I cannot address it without the piece information.\nPlacement_Plan: no_op\n",
