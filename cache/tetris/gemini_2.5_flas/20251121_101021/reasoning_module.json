    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot identify specific changes. However, the current board is very low, with column heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates a mostly empty board, with the left-most columns having a slight build-up.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no information about previous moves or thought processes in the current observation, so effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the slight unevenness on the left side of the board, specifically columns C0-C2. While minimal, maintaining a flat surface is crucial for long-term play. The rest of the board (C3-C9) is completely empty and offers ample space.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an `I_Line`. Given the board state, the `I_Line` is an excellent piece for leveling the current minor unevenness or creating a flat base for future pieces.\n    *   **Option 1 (Leveling):** Placing the `I_Line` horizontally, spanning columns C1-C4, would raise the lower columns (C1, C2) and slightly extend the height into C3 and C4. This would result in a flatter `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` profile, which is beneficial for future placements.\n    *   **Option 2 (Vertical Placement):** Placing the `I_Line` vertically in a deep well (if one existed) is also an option, but not currently suitable given the low board height.\n    The current priority should be to utilize the `I_Line` to maintain flatness and prepare for subsequent pieces, likely placing it horizontally to smooth out the existing minimal height differences.",
    "response": "thought: The board has column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I_Line.\nThe goal is to clear lines and keep the board as flat as possible.\nAn I_Line is 4 blocks long.\nIf placed vertically, it would make a column very high, which is not ideal at this stage.\nThe best use of an I_Line on this board is to place it horizontally to level out the existing minor unevenness and create a flat base.\n\nConsider placing the I_Line horizontally (which requires one ROTATE_LEFT or ROTATE_RIGHT from its initial vertical orientation).\nInitial I_Line spawn position is usually at the top, centered, vertically.\nIf it spawns at (C3, C4, C5, C6) vertically, rotating it would place it across 4 columns.\n\nLet's evaluate horizontal placements:\n1.  **Placement spanning C0-C3:**\n    *   Current heights: [2, 1, 1, 0, ...]\n    *   I-piece needs to be moved significantly left.\n    *   It would fill C0, C1, C2, C3 up to height 2 (assuming it clears a line at height 2 if C0, C1, C2 were filled).\n    *   If placed at the lowest possible point, it would land on C0 at height 2, and C1, C2 at height 1, and C3 at height 0.\n    *   Resulting heights: [3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (no line clear, but makes the left side higher).

This creates an undesirable step.\n\nThe optimal strategy for an I-line is often to create a 'tuck' or fill a long flat area. With the board so low, we want to maximize flatness and avoid creating new holes or unnecessarily high columns.\n\nLet's assume the I-line spawns vertically, centered. This means its blocks are initially in columns ~4, 5, 6, 7.\nTo get it to span C0-C3 or C1-C4 or C2-C5, it needs to be rotated first (to horizontal orientation) and then moved left.\n\nLet's reconsider the shape of the I-piece and its default spawn.\nAn I-piece is 4 blocks long.\nDefault spawn is vertical, usually around column 3/4 to 6/7.\nLet's assume the spawn columns are C3, C4, C5, C6 for its vertical orientation.\n\nTo be able to level C1, C2, C3, C4 to a height of 1 (by placing the I-piece over C1-C4), the I-piece needs to be rotated.\nOriginal state: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nLet's analyze potential horizontal placements from current height:\n\n*   **Option A: Place horizontally spanning C0-C3.**\n    *   This would mean the piece occupies (C0,y), (C1,y), (C2,y), (C3,y).\n    *   Given current heights: [2, 1, 1, 0], the lowest y position for this piece would be y=2, landing on C0. This would result in heights [3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This creates a hole under C0 if it was placed at y=2 directly over C1 and C2, and a higher column. Not good.\n\n*   **Option B: Place horizontally spanning C1-C4.**\n    *   This would mean the piece occupies (C1,y), (C2,y), (C3,y), (C4,y).\n    *   Given current heights: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0], the piece would land at y=1 for C1 and C2, and y=0 for C3 and C4.\n    *   This would result in: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    *   This seems like a good option for leveling the board. It raises C1 and C2 to height 2 (making them equal to C0), and C3 and C4 to height 1. It creates a flatter profile.\n\n*   **Option C: Place horizontally spanning C2-C5.**\n    *   Current heights: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   Piece would occupy (C2,y), (C3,y), (C4,y), (C5,y).\n    *   Lowest y would be y=1 for C2, and y=0 for C3, C4, C5. This would result in [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Not as flat as Option B.\n\nOption B seems to be the most optimal. It requires rotating the I-piece to horizontal, then moving it left until it spans C1-C4.\n\nLet's assume the I_Line spawns in columns 3,4,5,6 (vertical).\nTo get to C1-C4 (horizontal), we need:\n1.  Rotate: ROTATE_RIGHT (or ROTATE_LEFT, doesn't matter, just make it horizontal).\n2.  Move left: The I-piece is now 4 blocks wide. If it started centered, it would be roughly in columns 3,4,5,6. To shift it to C1,C2,C3,C4, it needs to move 2 times left. (e.g., if centered on C3, C4, C5, C6, then horizontal would be (C3,C4,C5,C6) at default height. Shift left to C1,C2,C3,C4).\n\nThe immediate action is to rotate the piece. Let's choose `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\n\nFull plan:\n1.  `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to make it horizontal)\n2.  `LEFT` (to shift it from default spawn position)\n3.  `LEFT` (to shift it further left to desired C1-C4 position)\n4.  Then `NO_OP` or `HARD_DROP` (implicit in most systems) to place it.\n\nThe current constraint is to output *one* action. The first action in the plan is `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\nthought: The current board state shows column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I_Line.\nThe most effective use of an I_Line on this low board is to place it horizontally to level out the existing minor unevenness on the left side and create a flatter base.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Rotate the I_Line to its horizontal orientation.\n2.  Move it left to span columns C1-C4.\n\nLet's analyze the resulting board state if the I_Line is placed horizontally spanning C1-C4:\n*   Current heights: C0=2, C1=1, C2=1, C3=0, C4=0.\n*   The horizontal I_Line would land such that its blocks occupy positions above the current highest point in each of these columns.\n*   This means the blocks would be at height y=2 for C1 and C2, and y=1 for C3 and C4 (assuming it's placed one block above the current height for columns C3 and C4).\n*   The resulting column heights would be: C0=2, C1=2, C2=2, C3=1, C4=1, C5=0, C6=0, C7=0, C8=0, C9=0.\n*   This creates a much flatter profile at a low height, which is ideal for long-term play and avoids creating holes.\n\nTo achieve this, the I_Line (which typically spawns vertically, centered) needs to be rotated first, and then moved left.\nAssuming a standard spawn location for a vertical I_Line (e.g., roughly centered from column 3 to 6).\nThe first necessary action is to rotate the piece to its horizontal orientation. Either ROTATE_LEFT or ROTATE_RIGHT will achieve this. I will choose `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left\nmove: rotate_right",

Shift left to C1,C2,C3,C4).\n\nThe immediate action is to rotate the piece. Let's choose `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\n\nFull plan:\n1.  `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to make it horizontal)\n2.  `LEFT` (to shift it from default spawn position)\n3.  `LEFT` (to shift it further left to desired C1-C4 position)\n4.  Then `NO_OP` or `HARD_DROP` (implicit in most systems) to place it.\n\nThe current constraint is to output *one* action. The first action in the plan is `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\nthought: The current board state shows column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I_Line.\nThe most effective use of an I_Line on this low board is to place it horizontally to level out the existing minor unevenness on the left side and create a flatter base.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Rotate the I_Line to its horizontal orientation.\n2.  Move it left to span columns C1-C4.\n\nLet's analyze the resulting board state if the I_Line is placed horizontally spanning C1-C4:\n*   Current heights: C0=2, C1=1, C2=1, C3=0, C4=0.\n*   The horizontal I_Line would land such that its blocks occupy positions above the current highest point in each of these columns.\n*   This means the blocks would be at height y=2 for C1 and C2, and y=1 for C3 and C4 (assuming it's placed one block above the current height for columns C3 and C4).\n*   The resulting column heights would be: C0=2, C1=2, C2=2, C3=1, C4=1, C5=0, C6=0, C7=0, C8=0, C9=0.\n*   This creates a much flatter profile at a low height, which is ideal for long-term play and avoids creating holes.\n\nTo achieve this, the I_Line (which typically spawns vertically, centered) needs to be rotated first, and then moved left.\nAssuming a standard spawn location for a vertical I_Line (e.g., roughly centered from column 3 to 6).\nThe first necessary action is to rotate the piece to its horizontal orientation. Either ROTATE_LEFT or ROTATE_RIGHT will achieve this. I will choose `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, left, left",

The current board presents a distinct setup: columns C0-C3 are uniformly filled to a height of 3, while columns C4-C9 are completely empty.\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior moves, the effectiveness of the last action cannot be directly evaluated. However, the current board state suggests a consistent strategy has been employed to build a solid 4-wide base on the left side, leaving a large open area on the right.\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The immediate area needing attention is the wide open space on the right side of the board (C4-C9). The active Z-Piece needs to be placed to either begin filling this void strategically or to continue supporting the left stack without creating large gaps.\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the current Z-Piece and the board's shape, the priority should be to establish a foundation on the right side to prevent the formation of a single tall column or deep holes. The Z-Piece could be used to bridge the gap between the left stack and the empty right side, or to start a new flat surface in columns C4-C5 to begin building up that half of the board.",

This is generally not ideal.\n    *   If placed completely on the empty right side (C4-C9) to start a new flat base:\n        Assuming the standard Z-piece shape, it would occupy 3 columns. If we place it such that it covers C4, C5, C6:\n        The resulting heights would be approximately C4:1, C5:2, C6:1.\n        The board would look like: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.\n        This creates a relatively flat and low base on the right side, which is good for future pieces and avoids creating immediate holes. This is a strong candidate.\n\n2.  **Placing the Z_Piece after rotation:**\n    *   The rotated Z_Piece is 2 units wide and 3 units tall.\n    *   If placed starting at C4, it would occupy C4 and C5.

Its best immediate use is likely to address the existing unevenness rather than starting a new, potentially messy structure on the completely empty right side.\n    *   Placing the Z-piece (without rotation) to cover columns C2 and C3 would raise their heights to 4, resulting in a more uniform `[5, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` left side.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, it's impossible to determine how the board has changed. Currently, the board features a significant height disparity: the leftmost columns (C0-C2) are relatively high at heights 7, 7, and 6 respectively. Column C3 creates a dip at height 3, and the right side of the board (C4-C9) is completely clear.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous context to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or the thought process behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the left side of the board (C0-C3). Columns C0-C2 are quite high, nearing the top. The significant drop-off at C3 (height 3 compared to C2's 6) creates an uneven surface that needs to be leveled out to facilitate line clears. While the right side (C4-C9) is completely clear, attention should first be given to managing the existing high blocks and unevenness on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the current board state and the unknown active piece:\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on Left:** Focus on clearing lines on the left side to reduce the heights of C0, C1, and C2.\n    *   **Address the Dip:** Look for opportunities to fill the gap at C3 to smooth out the surface and prevent holes from forming or deepening.\n    *   **Utilize Right Side:** The completely clear right side (C4-C9) offers a great opportunity for future line clears, potentially setting up a Tetris. However, this should only be pursued effectively once the left side is managed to avoid getting overwhelmed.\n    *   **Maintain Low Profile (Generally):** Avoid increasing the height of C0-C2 further without an immediate plan for a line clear.",

The deep well formed by the height difference between C2 (8) and C3 (3) is also a critical area requiring immediate attention to be filled strategically. The completely empty right side (C4-C9) represents a large, unutilized space that offers significant opportunities for building and line clears, and should be preserved as a clean area if possible.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the `Active Piece: UNKNOWN`, the strategy must remain flexible.\n    *   **Immediate Goal:** Begin leveling out the left side, specifically filling the well in C3 and reducing the height of C0-C2.\n    *   **Leverage Empty Space:** The vast empty area on the right (C4-C9) is a significant asset. Pieces should generally be moved towards this area to maximize placement options, especially if they are large or awkward. This also keeps the crucial high-left side from becoming even more cluttered with unnecessary pieces.\n    *   **Prioritize Flatness:** While clearing lines on the left, avoid creating new, deeper holes. Focus on creating horizontal lines to bring down the overall stack height.\n    *   **Anticipate I-piece:** If an I-piece comes, it could be used for a vertical line clear in the deep well, or horizontally along the empty right side to start a new, cleaner stack.\n\nGiven the current board state and the `UNKNOWN` active piece, the safest and most strategically sound immediate action is to move the piece towards the expansive empty area on the right. This increases potential placement options and gets the piece away from the congested left side, providing more time to react once the piece's shape is known.\n\nRIGHT",

This provides maximum flexibility for future rotations and horizontal adjustments once the piece type is revealed. Placing the piece immediately over the tall left stack or the deep well without knowing its shape risks creating further complications or blocking potential line clears. Moving right buys time and space.\n\nTherefore, the first action should be to move the piece to the right.

The board is heavily skewed, with significant height on the left side (columns C0-C2 are at heights 10, 10, and 11, respectively). There is a sharp drop-off, with column C3 at height 3, and columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a very deep well on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or the thought process behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Critical area: Leftmost columns (C0, C1, C2).** These are very high, nearing the top of the board. Clearing lines here is paramount to prevent topping out.\n    *   **Opportunity area: Right-side well (C3-C9).** The deep well starting at C3 and extending across the empty columns C4-C9 presents a significant opportunity for multi-line clears, especially Tetris clears (4 lines at once), once pieces start to fill this space.\n    *   **Unknown Active Piece:** With `Active Piece: UNKNOWN`, specific placement strategies are impossible to formulate, but general considerations remain.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on the Left:** The immediate goal should be to reduce the height of columns C0-C2. Look for opportunities to clear lines that involve these columns.\n    *   **Utilize the Right Well:** Aim to direct pieces towards the deep well on the right. This area offers the most space for dropping pieces and setting up line clears.\n    *   **Maintain Flatness (where possible):** As pieces fill the right side, try to keep the surface as flat as possible to avoid creating new holes or rough terrain, especially in the C3-C9 region.\n    *   **Generic Action Advice (due to UNKNOWN piece):** Since the active piece is unknown, I can only suggest general movement.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    This is the first observation, so no previous context is available for comparison.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior states or knowledge of the active piece for the last move, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness. The `Active Piece` is currently UNKNOWN.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is extremely uneven. Columns C0-C2 are significantly high (11, 12, 12), while C3 is low (3) and C4-C9 are completely empty. This creates a massive, deep canyon on the right side of the board that requires immediate attention. The left side is building up dangerously.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to fill the large void in columns C3-C9 and level the board. Prioritize placing pieces in the empty columns (C4-C9) and bridging the gap in C3, ideally creating flat surfaces for line clears. Avoid adding to the height of C0-C2 unless absolutely necessary to clear a line, as they are already quite tall. The current state is highly susceptible to topping out if pieces are placed carelessly on the left.",

Columns C0-C3 are all at height 13, forming a tall wall on the left, while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a massive, deep valley across more than half the board. Immediate attention is needed to address this extreme disparity.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right gap:** The primary objective must be to place pieces into the empty columns (C4-C9) to raise their height and level the board.\n    *   **Avoid further stacking on the left:** Do not place any more blocks on C0-C3 unless it results in an immediate and significant line clear.\n    *   **Seek line clears on the left:** While filling the right is key, any opportunity to clear lines from the high left side should be taken to reduce overall board height and relieve pressure.\n    *   **Adapt to unknown piece:** Given the `UNKNOWN` active piece, the strategy needs to be flexible. Any piece should be evaluated first for its potential to fill C4-C9, then for line clears on C0-C3 without worsening the imbalance.",

This is the initial observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on previous moves or the active piece that led to this state, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of any past actions.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board exhibits a severe height disparity. Columns C0-C3 are relatively high (heights 13-15), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates an enormous \"canyon\" on the right side of the board. The priority is to build up the right side (C4-C9) to even out the board and create flat surfaces for future line clears. Care must be taken not to create new holes in the taller left section while doing so.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the vast empty space on the right, the primary strategy must be to **deposit incoming pieces into columns C4-C9**. The goal is to fill this void systematically, preferably from left to right within that empty section (C4 moving towards C9) to create a new base. Since the active piece is unknown, specific placement advice is impossible, but the general principle is to prioritize filling the gap. Avoid placing pieces in C0-C3 unless it creates an immediate line clear or is absolutely necessary to prevent a hole.",
