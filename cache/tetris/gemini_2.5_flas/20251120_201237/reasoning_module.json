    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nAs I lack previous context, I cannot evaluate changes from prior states. However, the current board is very low and mostly empty, with a few blocks on the left (C0-C2).\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout knowledge of the last move or thought process, I cannot comment on its effectiveness.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe board is largely open. The primary area of focus should be columns C0, C1, and C2, which currently have heights of 2, 1, and 1 respectively. This creates a slight unevenness, but the board is so low that it's easy to manage. The vast majority of the board (C3-C9) is completely clear.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nGiven the very low and open board, the current strategy should prioritize:\n*   **Maintaining a flat profile:** Avoid creating unnecessary holes.\n*   **Building efficiently:** Place pieces to clear lines quickly and keep the stack low.\n*   **Setting up for combos:** With such an open board, there's ample opportunity to set up multiple line clears or T-Spins if the incoming pieces allow.\n*   The current unevenness on the left is minor and easily rectifiable. Focus on filling C1/C2 to match C0 if possible, or build upwards evenly across the board.",

Without a specific mapping or visual representation of the active piece, interpreting this array to precisely identify the piece type and its optimal placement is challenging.

The slight unevenness on the left (C0-C2) is minor.

This is a non-committal move that keeps options open and prevents premature interaction with the small existing stack on the left. It also begins the process of positioning the piece if the ultimate goal is to stack pieces on the right side of the board.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    This is the initial observation, so there are no previous states to compare against. The board starts with columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 each having a height of 3, while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    No prior moves have been made; this is the initial state of the game.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the large height disparity across the board. The left side (columns C0-C3) is partially filled to height 3, while the right side (C4-C9) is completely empty. This creates a significant \"trench\" or \"valley\" from C4 onwards. Attention is needed to fill this gap and level the board, or to create a designated well for future line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to address the unevenness. Future pieces should ideally be placed in columns C4-C9 to begin leveling the board. Care must be taken to not create new holes or make the existing height difference worse without an immediate clear. The goal should be to build a relatively flat surface to enable future line clears effectively.",

This shows a significant height disparity, with the left four columns at height 3 and the remaining six columns empty. My primary goal should be to level the board by filling the empty columns, ideally from C4 onwards, to set up for future line clears.\n\nHowever, the provided textual representation does not explicitly state what the *current active falling piece* is, nor does it visually render the piece on the board. The \"Board Feature Summary\" only describes the state of the settled blocks. The \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long, unstructured list of numbers that doesn't allow me to reliably infer the active piece's shape or position without further context or a key.\n\nWithout knowing the shape or current position of the active piece, I cannot determine the optimal rotation (ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) or horizontal movement (LEFT, RIGHT). Performing SOFT_DROP or HARD_DROP on an unknown piece in an unknown starting position could lead to undesirable outcomes like creating holes or stacking unevenly.\n\nTherefore, the most prudent and low-risk action in this situation, given the lack of information about the active piece, is to perform a NO_OP. This will allow the piece to fall one step naturally, and hopefully, the next game state observation will provide the necessary information to identify the piece and plan an effective placement.\n\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there's no previous context, I'll describe the current state. The board is heavily imbalanced. The left side (columns 0-3) has accumulated pieces, reaching heights of 5 in columns 0 and 1, and 3 in columns 2 and 3. The entire right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty (height 0).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without knowing the last move, it's hard to assess its effectiveness. However, the current board state indicates a significant left-skewed build-up. While the right side is pristine, the left side has a height disparity (5, 5, 3, 3) and is relatively high, which could make line clears challenging across the full width without appropriate pieces.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Right Side (C4-C9):** This large empty area is the primary focus. It's a blank canvas to build a flat base and prepare for future line clears, ideally a Tetris.\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C3):** The height difference between C0-C1 (height 5) and C2-C3 (height 3) needs careful attention. Future pieces should aim to level these columns if possible, without creating new holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy should be to utilize the completely empty right side (C4-C9) to establish a new, flat stacking area. Prioritize placing pieces on the right to build up its height, aiming to eventually create a T-spin setup or a Tetris well. Avoid further building on the already high left side unless a line clear is imminent. The significant drop-off from C3 to C4 makes it easy to place pieces quickly to the right.",

However, the overarching goal in this state is to utilize the large empty space on the right side.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    This is the initial observation for this reflection cycle, so no previous changes can be evaluated.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of any previous move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most striking feature is the dramatic disparity in column heights. The left side (C0-C2) is quite high and uneven (8, 9, 8), with a sharp drop to C3 (height 3). The right side of the board (C4-C9) is entirely empty. This creates a critical situation:\n    *   The high left side is approaching the top, creating immediate pressure.\n    *   The completely empty right side presents a massive opportunity to build, but also a challenge to bridge the gap from C3.\n    *   The significant height difference between C3 (3) and C4 (0) represents a large, open area that needs to be filled to create a more stable and playable surface.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to prioritize building up the empty right side (C4-C9) to establish a new base and flatten the board. Any piece that can fit efficiently on C4-C9 without creating new holes on the left should be considered. Avoid placing pieces on the already high left side (C0-C2) unless it completes a line clear or significantly reduces height and roughness. The goal is to incrementally fill C4-C9 while managing the height on the left to prevent an early game over.",

The critical challenge is that the shape and initial position of the active falling piece are not explicitly provided in the `textual_representation`. The prompt states, \"If using `textual_representation`, remember the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\" However, the \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" represents a static board state, and if the active piece were already \"included\" in these heights, it would imply the piece has already landed or fused, which contradicts the purpose of `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `ROTATE` actions for a falling piece. Furthermore, if \"Aggregate Stats\" contains the piece information, its format is not immediately clear, as the first 10 values `[9, 8, 10, 9, 10, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0]` differ from the `Board Feature Summary` and cannot represent a simple addition of a piece to the initial board heights (e.g., C1 decreases from 9 to 8, which is impossible for a landing piece).\n\nGiven this ambiguity and the requirement to output an action, I must operate under the assumption that a piece is falling, and I must make the most generally advantageous move despite not knowing its specific type or initial orientation.\n\nThe current board state is highly uneven:\n- Columns C0-C2 are high (8, 9, 8).\n- Column C3 has a moderate height (3).\n- Columns C4-C9 are completely empty (0).\n\nThe primary strategic goal is to flatten the board, fill the large empty space on the right (C4-C9), and manage the height on the left. Placing a piece on the already high left side (C0-C2) risks stacking too high too quickly, unless it clears lines. Building a new base on the right is crucial for long-term play.\n\nTherefore, moving any piece towards the right side of the board is a generally beneficial first step, as it positions the piece to begin filling the empty columns. Without knowing the piece, rotation is a gamble, and dropping prematurely is suboptimal. \"RIGHT\" is the most appropriate initial exploratory move to direct the piece towards the lower, open part of the board.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    No previous context was provided, so I cannot assess board changes or the effectiveness of past moves.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, it's impossible to evaluate the last move. However, the current board state presents significant challenges.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the left side, with columns C0, C1, and C2 at heights 10, 10, and 11 respectively. These columns are dangerously high and require immediate attention to clear lines. Simultaneously, columns C4 through C9 are completely empty, creating a massive disparity across the board and a deep \"canyon\" next to C3 (height 3). This large empty space needs to be built up in a controlled manner.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to level the board. This involves:\n    *   **Aggressive line clearing on the left:** Prioritize clearing lines to bring down the height of C0-C2.\n    *   **Strategic building on the right:** Utilize the empty C4-C9 space to create a flat, low foundation, potentially setting up a deep well (e.g., in C9 or C8) for future Tetris clears with 'I' pieces.\n    *   **Bridging the gap:** Pieces should be placed to gradually connect the C3 column (height 3) with the rising right side, avoiding isolated towers or new holes.\n    *   **Maintain options:** Avoid locking in pieces on the left that would prevent clears, and ensure the right side is built with flexibility for various piece types.",

    "reflection": "The board is in a highly imbalanced state.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, direct comparison is impossible. However, the current state shows a dramatic height disparity. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are very high (12, 13, 13 respectively), while the rest of the board (columns 4-9) is completely empty. Column 3 is extremely low at height 3, creating a large, deep chasm next to the towering left side. This indicates a significant build-up on the left side, with a largely unused or intentionally cleared right side.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Unable to determine the effectiveness of the last move without previous state information or the move itself. However, the resulting board state presents a challenge due to the extreme height difference. If the intention was to clear lines on the right, it was successful, but now the left is dangerously high. If it was an attempt to set up a specific clear on the left, the strategy is not immediately apparent given the sheer height.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Urgent Attention: Columns 0-2 (Left Wall):** These columns are nearing the top, creating immediate pressure. The primary focus must be on clearing lines from this region to reduce the overall height.\n    *   **Critical Gap: Column 3:** The deep drop-off from column 2 (height 13) to column 3 (height 3) represents a significant hole that needs careful consideration. Filling this gap without creating new holes or exacerbating the imbalance is crucial.\n    *   **Strategic Opportunity: Columns 4-9 (Right Side):** This area is completely clear, offering a blank canvas. This space can be used for maneuverability or to strategically build up to align with future line clears on the left, but currently, it contributes to the severe imbalance.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on the Left:** The immediate goal should be to reduce the height of columns 0-2. Look for opportunities to clear lines, especially Tetris (4-line clears) if possible, using upcoming pieces.\n    *   **Bridge the Gap:** Strategically place pieces to raise column 3 and reduce the height difference between the left and right sides. This needs to be done carefully to avoid creating unfillable holes.\n    *   **Level the Board Gradually:** While clearing lines on the left, start building up the right side (columns 4-9) in a controlled manner, aiming for a flatter profile overall.\n    *   **Avoid New Holes:** Given the high current height, creating new holes on the left would be detrimental. Every piece placement should consider minimizing roughness and internal holes.",
    "response": "thought: The current game state presents a challenging board with a significant height disparity. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are very high (12, 13, 13), column 3 has a deep hole (height 3), and columns 4-9 are completely empty. The primary goals are to reduce the maximum height on the left, fill the hole in column 3, and generally level out the board.\n\nA critical piece of information, the current falling tetromino's shape, is missing from the provided \"Current Game State\" and is not clearly identifiable from the \"Aggregate Stats\" vector.

While these columns eventually need to be built up, the immediate and most pressing issues are the high stack on the left and the deep hole in column 3. Moving right would take the piece further away from these critical areas.\n3.  **ROTATE_LEFT / ROTATE_RIGHT**: Rotating without knowing the piece's shape is a pure gamble. It could make the piece fit better or worse, or not change anything (e.g., O-piece). This is too risky as a default first move.\n4.  **LEFT**: Assuming the piece spawns in a typical central location (e.g., starting its leftmost block in column 3 or 4), moving the piece one step to the left would bring it closer to the problematic columns (0-3). This increases the chances of being able to place the piece in column 3 to fill the gap, or on top of columns 0-2 to contribute to a line clear. This is the most proactive move that brings the piece towards the area of greatest need without making an irreversible or potentially harmful rotational commitment.\n\nTherefore, moving `LEFT` is the most logical first step to get the piece into a more strategically relevant position on the board, closer to the high stacks and the critical hole.\n\nmove: LEFT",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context was provided, I cannot comment on how the board has changed. However, the current board state shows a highly uneven distribution: columns 0-3 are all at height 15, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This creates a deep and wide well on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior moves or an explicit record of the last action, I cannot assess its effectiveness. The current state, with 75% of the board's height concentrated on the left, suggests that previous moves may have been focused on creating this specific setup, potentially for a large multi-line clear (e.g., T-spin setups or a very deep Tetris well).\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the massive height disparity. The left side (columns 0-3) is very high, close to the top of the board. The right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty. The priority is to manage the left side to prevent topping out and to strategically fill the right side to clear lines.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current board state presents a significant opportunity for large line clears if the right pieces are available. The primary strategy should be to:\n    *   **Utilize the deep well:** Focus on placing pieces into columns 4-9 to level out the board and set up multiple line clears, especially Tetrises with 'I' pieces.\n    *   **Avoid further height on left:** Be extremely cautious about adding any more blocks to columns 0-3, as they are already critically high.\n    *   **Prioritize clearing:** Every move should ideally contribute to either clearing lines or setting up a future line clear, with a strong preference for using the empty right side.",
    "response": "thought: The board state shows columns 0-3 are critically high (height 15), while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This presents a dangerous situation on the left and a large well on the right. My primary goal is to direct any falling piece into the empty well on the right to clear lines and reduce the overall board height, particularly avoiding adding to the left-side stack.\n\nUnfortunately, the \"Aggregate Stats\" and \"Board Feature Summary\" do not explicitly provide the shape or orientation of the *active falling piece* in an easily parsable format. This makes it impossible to plan an optimal rotation or a precise horizontal placement.\n\nGiven this lack of information about the active piece, I must make a general decision that is most likely to be beneficial. Assuming the piece spawns in a central location (e.g., columns 3-6), moving it to the right is the most logical first step to shift it away from the dangerously high columns (0-3) and towards the deep, empty well (4-9). This action aims to utilize the vast empty space and avoids further increasing the height on the already stacked left side. Any rotation without knowing the piece shape is a gamble, and a `NO_OP` or `LEFT` would likely exacerbate the height problem. Therefore, `RIGHT` is the best general move under these highly constrained information circumstances.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Given no previous context, direct comparison is not possible. However, the current board state is highly unusual and suggests a significant transformation has occurred. The left side (columns C0-C3) is nearly full, reaching heights of 15-17, while the entire right half of the board (columns C4-C9) is completely empty. This dramatic height disparity indicates either a massive line clear operation focused on the right side or a specific \"funneling\" strategy has been executed to create this vast empty space.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior moves or goals, effectiveness cannot be directly assessed. If the intention was to create a large vertical well for a Tetris or T-spin setup, or to clear many lines on the right, then it was successful in achieving this board shape. If this state was unintended, it presents a challenging recovery scenario due to the severe imbalance.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **The immense well (C4-C9):** This is the most critical area. It needs to be filled to level out the board and reduce the high stack on the left. This space also offers a prime opportunity for multiple line clears if managed correctly.\n    *   **High columns on the left (C0-C3):** While not immediately critical, these columns are very high (15-17), meaning only a few more blocks could lead to a game over. Any pieces placed should aim to contribute to line clears on this side or be used to build up the right side.\n    *   **The \"cliff\" between C3 and C4:** This sharp drop needs to be carefully managed. Pieces should ideally bridge this gap or create a clean line to prevent awkward holes when building up the right side.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right side:** The primary goal should be to safely build up columns C4-C9, starting from C4 to connect with the existing structure at C3. This will help level the board and prevent topping out on the left.\n    *   **Seek line clears:** As the right side is built, focus on setting up and executing line clears, especially Tetrises, to reduce the overall height.\n    *   **Leverage the deep well:** This configuration is highly conducive to performing a Tetris (4-line clear) with an I-block or even advanced T-spin setups if the next pieces allow. The agent should be looking for these opportunities.\n    *   **Maintain flatness on the right:** While building up the right side, aim to keep the new surface as flat as possible to avoid creating new unfillable holes.\n    *   **Consider \"holding\" pieces:** If the agent has a hold function, saving an I-block for a future Tetris would be a strong strategic play.\n\nGiven the wide-open space on the right, the most immediate general action, regardless of the next piece, would be to explore moving it into that area.\n\n**Action:** RIGHT",
    "response": "thought: The board has a very distinct structure: the left side is almost full (heights 16-17), while the entire right side (columns C4-C9) is completely empty. This creates a massive vertical well. I do not have information about the current falling piece or its initial position. However, it is highly probable that the piece spawns near the center of the board. To utilize the vast open space on the right and begin leveling out the board, the piece needs to be moved towards the right side. Moving 'RIGHT' is the most sensible first action to shift the piece into position over the empty columns, regardless of its specific shape or current exact coordinates. This moves the piece away from the dangerously high left side and towards the area where it's needed most for future line clears and board balancing.\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, direct comparison is impossible. However, the current state shows an extremely imbalanced board. The left four columns (C0-C3) are almost completely filled (heights 19, 19, 17, 15), while the right six columns (C4-C9) are entirely empty. This suggests a history of consistently placing pieces on the left, leading to a critical state on that side.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot be determined without knowing the last move. However, the current board state indicates that recent strategies have been ineffective at managing the overall height and distribution of pieces, as the left side is near game over, leaving no room for error.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Immediate Danger:** Columns C0 and C1 are at height 19, meaning one more block will result in a game over if it lands there. C2 and C3 are also critically high.\n    *   **Opportunity:** Columns C4-C9 are completely empty, representing a massive blank canvas for future piece placement and line clearing.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Survival is paramount:** Absolutely no more pieces should be placed on columns C0, C1, C2, or C3 if it increases their height.\n    *   **Shift focus entirely to the right:** All incoming pieces must be maneuvered to the empty right side (C4-C9). This is the only viable area to build and create clearing opportunities.\n    *   **Prioritize building a flat base or a well on the right:** Start building from the bottom of C4-C9 to create a stable foundation, potentially aiming for a Tetris well in C9 or C0 (if C0 can be cleared down later, which is currently impossible).\n    *   **Avoid creating holes:** As pieces are placed on the right, ensure new holes are not formed, which would further complicate the board.\n    *   This current state reflects a severe lack of board balance. The AI must prioritize utilizing the vast open space on the right to clear lines and reduce the immediate threat on the left, which can only happen if pieces are cleared *below* the current critical heights.",
    "response": "thought: The most critical piece of information for making an optimal Tetris move, the active falling piece's shape and current position, is not explicitly provided in the \"Board Feature Summary\" or the \"Aggregate Stats\". The prompt states \"the board shown already includes the active piece\" if using `textual_representation`, but the provided textual data does not include a 2D board visualization to deduce the active piece.\n\nHowever, I must choose an action. Analyzing the \"Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [19, 19, 17, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", it's clear that columns C0, C1, C2, and C3 are critically high, with C0 and C1 being one block away from game over. Columns C4 through C9 are completely empty.\n\nGiven this extreme board imbalance, the strategic imperative is to move *any* incoming piece away from the left side and towards the vast empty space on the right. Assuming a piece spawns in a somewhat central position (e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7), the most appropriate first action is to initiate a horizontal shift to the right. This moves the piece away from the danger zone and towards the playable area. Without knowing the piece's shape, rotation is a gamble, and dropping it immediately (soft/hard drop) would likely lead to a bad placement.

This implies a fresh game start or a complete board clear, as there is no previous context to compare against.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There was no prior move to evaluate, as this appears to be the initial state of the game or a new game entirely.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Currently, no specific areas of the board require immediate \"attention\" due to irregularities like holes or high stacks, as it's entirely empty. All columns are at height 0. The attention now shifts to the incoming piece and establishing a solid foundation.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given an empty board, the primary strategy is to build a low and flat base. It's crucial to begin planning for a Tetris-clearing \"well\" (typically in column 0 or 9) from the very first piece. Avoid creating any holes in the initial layers. The first few piece placements will dictate the flow and potential for future line clears.",

Without knowing the shape of the current falling piece, it's impossible to plan a specific optimal rotation or exact placement. However, a general strategy for an empty board is to aim for a flat base and start preparing for a Tetris-well on one side. I will assume the piece spawns in the middle columns. To initiate building a flat base and perhaps leaving an opening on the left side (column 0) for a future I-piece (a common strategy), I will slightly shift the current piece to the right. This is a non-committal initial move that allows for further adjustments on subsequent turns once the piece type is known.\nmove: RIGHT",

    "response": "thought: The current game state shows a board with columns 0-3 filled to height 5, and columns 4-9 completely empty. This creates a large well on the right side. The 'Aggregate Stats' are long, but the critical part is the 'Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'. This confirms the visual interpretation.\n\nThe problem states \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" and \"Aggregate Stats\" which is a very long string of numbers. I need to identify the active piece and its position to determine the best move.\n\nThe 'textual_representation' is the primary source of information here. It describes the current board and other stats. However, it *doesn't* explicitly state what the current falling piece is, nor does it show a detailed 2D board state. It only gives the column heights and a very long \"Aggregate Stats\" vector.\n\nThe prompt states: \"If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes: - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board). - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces. - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\"\n\nHowever, the provided `textual_representation` *only* contains \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" and the very long \"Aggregate Stats\". It does *not* contain a 2D array, nor explicit active piece identification, nor next piece information (like \"N:[next_piece_ids]\").\n\nThis is a critical lack of information. Without knowing the shape of the current falling piece, it's impossible to make an optimal placement decision. Every action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) depends on the active piece's shape and current orientation/position.\n\nGiven this severe limitation, I cannot determine an \"optimal\" move. The prompt expects me to \"plan the optimal next move\" and \"provide your reasoning\".\n\nIf I cannot identify the piece, any move would be a guess.\n- Moving LEFT/RIGHT without knowing the piece might move it into an undesired position or against the wall.\n- Rotating without knowing the piece is equally risky, as different pieces have different rotation behaviors and occupied space.\n- Soft_drop/Hard_drop would fix the piece in its current unknown state, which is almost certainly suboptimal.\n\nIn such a scenario, where essential information (the active piece) is missing, the safest default action is usually `NO_OP` or `SOFT_DROP` if I absolutely must move it down. However, the objective is \"optimal placement\".\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\"\n\nThe board has a huge well. The ideal strategy is to fill it. But *with what*? I don't know.\n\nThe problem says \"The board shown already includes the active piece.\" This is a crucial statement for `textual_representation` where a 2D array is given. However, the `textual_representation` here is *only* the column height vector and the aggregate stats vector. It does *not* provide a 2D array representation that would implicitly show the active piece.\n\nLet's assume the \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector\" is the *initial* state *before* a piece starts falling. This seems to be the only logical interpretation if no piece is implied to be on the board yet, and no piece type is given. If a piece were already falling and *rendered* on the board, the column heights would reflect that, especially for columns 4-9 if it were centered. But columns 4-9 are all 0, implying nothing is there yet.\n\nTherefore, I am in a state where I know the board, but not the piece. This is a common situation where 'next piece' information is often provided. The aggregate stats string *might* contain the next piece type, but it's a very long numerical vector ([5, 8, 5, 4, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 12, ...]) and without a key or clear structure, it's impossible to parse it for the next piece type. Standard Tetris state representations often clearly separate this.\n\nGiven the goal to \"help place pieces optimally\", and the severe lack of information about the active piece:\n1. I cannot determine the active piece.\n2. I cannot determine the next piece.\n3. The board state itself (columns 0-3 are height 5, columns 4-9 are height 0) implies a deep well.\n\nSince I am asked to provide *one* action string, and I cannot infer the active piece, any move would be arbitrary. However, I *must* choose one.\n\nIn real Tetris, if you don't know the piece, you typically can't make an optimal first move other than waiting. But `NO_OP` implies doing nothing, which isn't progressing the game. The game expects a move to be chosen.\n\nIf I had to make a completely blind guess to *initiate* filling the well, often players try to keep the well open (e.g., place pieces on one side) to allow for I-pieces later. But I don't know what piece is coming.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Aggregate Stats\" vector: `[5, 8, 5, 4, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 12, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 5, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 10, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 12, 6, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 10, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 12, 6, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 12, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 12, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 12, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 12, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 8, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 8, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]`\n\nThis \"Aggregate Stats\" vector is extremely long and repetitive. It seems like it's a concatenation of many different game states or feature vectors. A key part is \"Next Piece Type\". If it's embedded, it's not explicitly labeled.\n\nGiven the constraints, I have to make a choice. If I *must* make a move and have no information about the current piece, the safest assumption might be that a piece is falling in the default spawn position (top center).\n\nA common strategy when faced with a large well (like columns 4-9 being empty) is to try and build up from one side, keeping a 'T-spin' or 'Tetris' well open. Since columns 0-3 are already occupied, the natural side to build from is the right.\n\nIf an I-piece were falling, I'd want to drop it into the well horizontally. If an O-piece, it could start filling from the right. T, L, J, S, Z pieces could also be used.\n\nSince I have literally no information about the current piece's shape or even its initial spawn position, I cannot perform an optimal move.\n\nHowever, if I assume the piece spawns at the top-middle and I want to start filling the well from the right to prepare for a Tetris clear, I would generally want to move pieces towards the right.\n\nLet's assume there is *some* piece, spawning near the middle (say, column 3-6 or 4-7 depending on piece width). To influence it towards the large empty area on the right, `RIGHT` is the only action that makes sense without further knowledge.\n\nIt's a guess, but it's the only one that attempts to engage with the primary feature of the board (the well) with the least amount of downside risk compared to a rotation (which could put an unknown piece into an awkward orientation) or a hard drop (which would fix it in an unknown and possibly bad position). A `NO_OP` just passes the turn, which isn't what the game engine usually wants; it wants an action to influence the piece.\n\nTherefore, the best I can do with *missing* information is to make a move that generally aims towards the larger empty area, which is the right side.\nThis reasoning is based on the significant information gap.\nLet's assume the piece is an arbitrary standard tetromino. Moving it `RIGHT` by one column is a common initial adjustment to position pieces, especially when aiming for a specific side of the board (in this case, the right-side well).\nthought: The current game state indicates a board with columns 0-3 filled to a height of 5, and columns 4-9 completely empty, forming a large well on the right side. Critically, the provided `textual_representation` (Board Feature Summary and Aggregate Stats) does not explicitly state the shape of the current falling piece, nor its initial spawn position, nor any upcoming pieces. This is a severe lack of information needed to make an \"optimal\" decision.\n\nGiven the prompt's instruction to provide one action, and the inability to identify the active piece, any move will be speculative. However, a move must be made.\n\nMy strategic goal is to begin filling the large empty well on the right (columns 4-9) in a controlled manner, aiming for flat surfaces or preparing for line clears. Without knowing the piece, I cannot determine the exact optimal placement or rotation.\n\nIf I assume a standard tetromino spawns near the center of the board, a single `RIGHT` move would begin to shift the piece towards the open well, which is the most strategically relevant area of the board to address. This is a general \"move to the open area\" heuristic, which is the safest blind guess in the absence of piece information, compared to rotation (which might make an unknown piece much worse) or a premature drop.\n\nTherefore, to attempt to interact with the well by moving any assumed piece towards it, `RIGHT` is the most logical first action.\n\nmove: RIGHT",
    "thought": "The current game state shows a board with columns 0-3 filled to height 5, and columns 4-9 completely empty. This creates a large well on the right side. The 'Aggregate Stats' are long, but the critical part is the 'Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]'. This confirms the visual interpretation.\n\nThe problem states \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" and \"Aggregate Stats\" which is a very long string of numbers. I need to identify the active piece and its position to determine the best move.\n\nThe 'textual_representation' is the primary source of information here. It describes the current board and other stats. However, it *doesn't* explicitly state what the current falling piece is, nor does it show a detailed 2D board state. It only gives the column heights and a very long \"Aggregate Stats\" vector.\n\nThe prompt states: \"If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This text typically includes: - The game board as a 2D array (where non-zero values represent pieces, and the active piece is already rendered on this board). - \"N:[next_piece_ids]\" for upcoming pieces. - \"S:score L:lines_cleared V:level\" for game statistics.\"\n\nHowever, the provided `textual_representation` *only* contains \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" and the very long \"Aggregate Stats\". It does *not* contain a 2D array, nor explicit active piece identification, nor next piece information (like \"N:[next_piece_ids]\").\n\nThis is a critical lack of information. Without knowing the shape of the current falling piece, it's impossible to make an optimal placement decision. Every action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) depends on the active piece's shape and current orientation/position.\n\nGiven this severe limitation, I cannot determine an \"optimal\" move. The prompt expects me to \"plan the optimal next move\" and \"provide your reasoning\".\n\nIf I cannot identify the piece, any move would be a guess.\n- Moving LEFT/RIGHT without knowing the piece might move it into an undesired position or against the wall.\n- Rotating without knowing the piece is equally risky, as different pieces have different rotation behaviors and occupied space.\n- Soft_drop/Hard_drop would fix the piece in its current unknown state, which is almost certainly suboptimal.\n\nIn such a scenario, where essential information (the active piece) is missing, the safest default action is usually `NO_OP` or `SOFT_DROP` if I absolutely must move it down. However, the objective is \"optimal placement\".\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"The game board is a grid where pieces (tetrominoes) fall from the top. Your goal is to clear lines by filling all cells in a row, which removes that row. The game ends if the pieces stack up to the top of the board.\"\n\nThe board has a huge well. The ideal strategy is to fill it. But *with what*? I don't know.\n\nThe problem says \"The board shown already includes the active piece.\" This is a crucial statement for `textual_representation` where a 2D array is given. However, the `textual_representation` here is *only* the column height vector and the aggregate stats vector. It does *not* provide a 2D array representation that would implicitly show the active piece.\n\nLet's assume the \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector\" is the *initial* state *before* a piece starts falling. This seems to be the only logical interpretation if no piece is implied to be on the board yet, and no piece type is given. If a piece were already falling and *rendered* on the board, the column heights would reflect that, especially for columns 4-9 if it were centered. But columns 4-9 are all 0, implying nothing is there yet.\n\nTherefore, I am in a state where I know the board, but not the piece. This is a common situation where 'next piece' information is often provided. The aggregate stats string *might* contain the next piece type, but it's a very long numerical vector ([5, 8, 5, 4, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 12, ...]) and without a key or clear structure, it's impossible to parse it for the next piece type. Standard Tetris state representations often clearly separate this.\n\nGiven the goal to \"help place pieces optimally\", and the severe lack of information about the active piece:\n1. I cannot determine the active piece.\n2. I cannot determine the next piece.\n3. The board state itself (columns 0-3 are height 5, columns 4-9 are height 0) implies a deep well.\n\nSince I am asked to provide *one* action string, and I cannot infer the active piece, any move would be arbitrary. However, I *must* choose one.\n\nIn real Tetris, if you don't know the piece, you typically can't make an optimal first move other than waiting. But `NO_OP` implies doing nothing, which isn't progressing the game. The game expects a move to be chosen.\n\nIf I had to make a completely blind guess to *initiate* filling the well, often players try to keep the well open (e.g., place pieces on one side) to allow for I-pieces later. But I don't know what piece is coming.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Aggregate Stats\" vector: `[5, 8, 5, 4, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 12, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 5, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 10, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 12, 6, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 10, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 12, 6, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 12, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 12, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 12, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 12, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 12, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 8, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 8, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]`\n\nThis \"Aggregate Stats\" vector is extremely long and repetitive. It seems like it's a concatenation of many different game states or feature vectors. A key part is \"Next Piece Type\". If it's embedded, it's not explicitly labeled.\n\nGiven the constraints, I have to make a choice. If I *must* make a move and have no information about the current piece, the safest assumption might be that a piece is falling in the default spawn position (top center).\n\nA common strategy when faced with a large well (like columns 4-9 being empty) is to try and build up from one side, keeping a 'T-spin' or 'Tetris' well open. Since columns 0-3 are already occupied, the natural side to build from is the right.\n\nIf an I-piece were falling, I'd want to drop it into the well horizontally. If an O-piece, it could start filling from the right. T, L, J, S, Z pieces could also be used.\n\nSince I have literally no information about the current piece's shape or even its initial spawn position, I cannot perform an optimal move.\n\nHowever, if I assume the piece spawns at the top-middle and I want to start filling the well from the right to prepare for a Tetris clear, I would generally want to move pieces towards the right.\n\nLet's assume there is *some* piece, spawning near the middle (say, column 3-6 or 4-7 depending on piece width). To influence it towards the large empty area on the right, `RIGHT` is the only action that makes sense without further knowledge.\n\nIt's a guess, but it's the only one that attempts to engage with the primary feature of the board (the well) with the least amount of downside risk compared to a rotation (which could put an unknown piece into an awkward orientation) or a hard drop (which would fix it in an unknown and possibly bad position). A `NO_OP` just passes the turn, which isn't what the game engine usually wants; it wants an action to influence the piece.\n\nTherefore, the best I can do with *missing* information is to make a move that generally aims towards the larger empty area, which is the right side.\nThis reasoning is based on the significant information gap.\nLet's assume the piece is an arbitrary standard tetromino. Moving it `RIGHT` by one column is a common initial adjustment to position pieces, especially when aiming for a specific side of the board (in this case, the right-side well).\nthought: The current game state indicates a board with columns 0-3 filled to a height of 5, and columns 4-9 completely empty, forming a large well on the right side. Critically, the provided `textual_representation` (Board Feature Summary and Aggregate Stats) does not explicitly state the shape of the current falling piece, nor its initial spawn position, nor any upcoming pieces. This is a severe lack of information needed to make an \"optimal\" decision.\n\nGiven the prompt's instruction to provide one action, and the inability to identify the active piece, any move will be speculative. However, a move must be made.\n\nMy strategic goal is to begin filling the large empty well on the right (columns 4-9) in a controlled manner, aiming for flat surfaces or preparing for line clears. Without knowing the piece, I cannot determine the exact optimal placement or rotation.\n\nIf I assume a standard tetromino spawns near the center of the board, a single `RIGHT` move would begin to shift the piece towards the open well, which is the most strategically relevant area of the board to address. This is a general \"move to the open area\" heuristic, which is the safest blind guess in the absence of piece information, compared to rotation (which might make an unknown piece much worse) or a premature drop.\n\nTherefore, to attempt to interact with the well by moving any assumed piece towards it, `RIGHT` is the most logical first action.",

My reflection is based solely on the current observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the previous state or the last move, I cannot determine its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is severely imbalanced. Columns C0-C3 are relatively high (heights 8, 9, 9, 5 respectively), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). The most critical area needing attention is the vast empty space on the right side of the board (C4-C9). The left side (C0-C3) also exhibits some roughness (e.g., the drop from C2 to C3), which could lead to holes if not managed carefully.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right side:** The primary strategic objective must be to bring up the column heights on the right side (C4-C9) as quickly and efficiently as possible. This will balance the board and create opportunities for wide line clears.\n    *   **Maintain a flat profile on the right:** As pieces are placed on the right, strive to keep the top of the newly formed columns as flat as possible to avoid creating new depressions or 'holes'.\n    *   **Utilize long pieces for efficiency:** If an 'I' piece becomes available, it would be extremely valuable to quickly build up the height across multiple columns on the right (e.g., C4-C7 or C5-C8).\n    *   **Avoid exacerbating the left:** While focusing on the right, be mindful not to further increase the height or create deeper holes on the already high and somewhat uneven left side without clearing lines.\n    *   **Prepare for line clears:** Once the right side begins to fill, look for opportunities to set up a wide well, ideally on C9 or C0, to clear multiple lines simultaneously, especially a Tetris.\n\n*(Note: The `Aggregate Stats` string provided is very long and does not explicitly label the 'Next Piece Type' in an easily parseable format within the current observation.

The left side (columns C0-C3) is built up, with heights ranging from 5 to 11 (C0 and C1 are 11, C2 is 9, C3 is 5). In stark contrast, the right side (columns C4-C9) is completely empty (height 0). This creates a critical, deep well on the right that needs immediate attention. The height difference between C3 (5) and C4 (0) is a significant structural issue.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:** The primary strategy must be to fill the large void on the right side (C4-C9) to level the board and prepare for line clears. Given the completely open rightmost columns, this board state is perfectly set up for establishing a Tetris well (keeping C9 or C8 open for vertical 'I' pieces). Pieces should be moved to the right and placed strategically to build up the empty columns while aiming for a flat surface to enable future line clears. Simultaneously, avoid increasing the height on the already tall left side (C0-C3) unless absolutely necessary for an immediate line clear.\n\nRIGHT",

However, the overarching strategy must be to fill the large void on the right side of the board.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Lacking previous context, I observe the current board has developed an extreme imbalance. A high wall has formed on the left side (C0-C2, heights 12-13), while column C3 is significantly lower (height 5), creating a deep well. The right side of the board (C4-C9) is completely clear, forming a massive open space. This indicates a recent accumulation of pieces primarily on the left.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    The current board state suggests that recent moves have been focused on the left side, or have inadvertently led to this highly uneven structure. While this might be a setup for a specific advanced strategy (e.g., T-spin opportunity with the C3 well), on its own, it presents a challenging situation with high overall height on one side and a large open area that could be difficult to fill efficiently. The effectiveness is questionable unless this setup is intentional for an immediate, high-scoring clear.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Columns C0-C2:** These columns are critically high (12-13). Reducing their height through line clears is paramount to avoid topping out.\n    *   **Column C3:** The deep well at height 5 needs to be either filled carefully without creating new holes or integrated into a multi-line clear strategy.\n    *   **Columns C4-C9:** This vast empty space represents both an opportunity and a challenge. It needs to be filled methodically to create a new, flat base, or used to build a coherent stack without creating new, internal gaps.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to manage the height on the left while concurrently building a stable foundation on the right. Prioritize line clears involving C0-C2. Utilize the open C4-C9 area to stack pieces flatly and efficiently, perhaps leaving a single-column well on the far right for I-tetrominoes if possible. Avoid creating new holes, especially in the clear right section.",
    "response": "thought: I am unable to identify the active falling piece and its current position from the provided `textual_representation`. The `Board Feature Summary` only provides column heights, and the `Aggregate Stats` is a long list of numbers that does not clearly describe the active piece's shape or current coordinates. The problem statement explicitly mentions that the textual representation should include the 2D board with the active piece rendered, but this information is missing.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, it is impossible to plan an optimal move involving rotation or precise placement to clear lines or build effectively. Any specific action (rotate, left, right, soft drop, hard drop) would be a guess.\n\nHowever, I am required to output an action. Given the board state, with high columns on the left ([12, 13, 12]) and a deep well at C3 (height 5), followed by completely empty columns on the right (C4-C9), moving a piece towards the open, clear area on the right (C4-C9) is a generally safer heuristic when the piece is unknown. This avoids stacking higher on the already tall left side and moves it towards an area where a flatter base can be built. A single `RIGHT` move is a cautious first step towards this strategy.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, this reflection serves as an initial assessment. The board currently shows a significant imbalance: columns C0-C2 are very high (15, 15, 14), C3 is at height 5, and columns C4-C9 are completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the last move is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area of concern is the left side of the board (C0-C2) due to its high stack height, which is approaching the top. While the right side (C4-C9) is completely empty and looks like a perfect well, the immediate danger is in managing the excessive height on the left and preventing a game over.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current board state presents a classic Tetris well opportunity on the right. The strategy should focus on carefully building a flat surface across C4-C8 while preserving C9 as a \"well\" for future Tetris clears. Simultaneously, it is crucial to avoid further increasing the height on the left side (C0-C2) and to look for opportunities to clear lines, especially on the left, as the right side is built up. Prioritize pieces that can fit into the empty space on the right without creating new holes or exacerbating the height on the left. The high stack on the left means limited room for error.",

The most immediate danger is stacking pieces further on the left, which could lead to a game over. Without knowing the specific shape or current spawn position of the active falling piece, the safest and most strategically sound move is to direct the piece towards the lower, empty portion of the board. Moving the piece to the right will steer it away from the dangerous high stack and towards the open area where it can potentially be placed without creating holes or exacerbating the height issue. This is a general defensive move when the active piece's type is unknown but the board has a clear danger zone.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context is provided, I can only assess the current state. The board is severely unbalanced. The left side (columns C0-C2) is critically high, ranging from heights 16 to 17. In stark contrast, the right side (columns C4-C9) is completely empty. Column C3 is at a moderate height of 5, acting as a steep drop-off.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the *last* specific move. However, the current highly imbalanced state suggests a pattern of past moves that either neglected the right side or focused too heavily on the left, leading to this dangerous build-up.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Critical:** Columns C0, C1, and C2 are extremely high and pose an immediate game-over threat. Clearing lines on this left side is paramount for survival.\n    *   **Opportunity:** The completely empty columns C4-C9 represent a significant opportunity to build a stable base and prepare for multi-line clears.\n    *   **Transition:** Column C3 needs careful consideration to either connect the high left with the empty right or to set up a clean, flat surface as the right side is built up.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on Left:** The immediate goal must be to reduce the height of C0-C2. Look for opportunities to complete lines on the left, even if it's just single line clears.\n    *   **Build Up Right Side Prudently:** Begin filling columns C4-C9, aiming for a flat, low base. Avoid creating new holes on the right.\n    *   **Utilize T-pieces/L-pieces for bridging:** Pieces that can span the gap from C3 to C4 (or further right) will be valuable for creating a more even playing field.\n    *   **Avoid further height on Left:** Unless a piece directly clears a line on C0-C2, try to avoid placing blocks that further increase their height.\n    *   **Seek Tetris Potential:** Once the right side is built up, the goal should be to create a well for a Tetris, which will be crucial for recovery and efficiency given the high left side.",
    "response": "thought: I am missing critical information about the active falling piece, specifically its shape and current position. The `textual_representation` only provides the `Column Heights Vector` and a very long, unstructured `Aggregate Stats` vector, neither of which directly identifies the active piece. The prompt states that the `Column Heights Vector` *includes* the active piece, but if it's already \"included\" and forming part of the heights, then the concept of \"planning the next move\" (like rotate or move left/right) for *that* piece becomes contradictory. I will assume the `Column Heights Vector` represents the *static* board and a new, unknown piece is currently falling from the top.\n\nGiven the severe imbalance of the board with columns C0-C2 being extremely high (16, 17, 16) and columns C4-C9 being completely empty (0), the immediate priority is to avoid stacking higher on the left. The long-term goal is to clear lines from the left and flatten the board by building up the right side.\n\nSince the piece type and its initial spawn position are unknown, I cannot plan for a specific rotation or a precise placement to clear lines. A general, safe strategy is to move the piece towards the empty part of the board to prevent it from contributing to the already dangerous heights on the left. Assuming pieces typically spawn in the middle columns (e.g., C3-C6), moving it `RIGHT` will shift it towards the open columns C4-C9. This minimizes the risk of immediately worsening the high left side and provides more space for placement in future moves.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate how the board has changed. However, the current state is highly imbalanced, which suggests that previous moves have led to the left side becoming significantly higher than the right.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As there is no previous context, the effectiveness of the last move cannot be assessed directly. However, the current board state, with columns C0-C3 at height 18 and C4-C9 completely empty, indicates that the overall strategy leading up to this point has created a highly precarious situation with severe imbalance and limited play space on one side.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the left side of the board (columns C0-C3), which is dangerously high (height 18). Immediate attention must be given to clearing lines in these columns to prevent a game over. The vast empty space on the right side (columns C4-C9) also needs attention to begin re-balancing the board, but this is secondary to the immediate threat on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy must be focused on survival by clearing lines on the left. Every incoming piece should be evaluated for its potential to reduce the height in columns C0-C3, even if it means only clearing a single line. Once the immediate threat of topping out is mitigated, the next step is to start filling in the right side of the board (columns C4-C9) to create a more balanced and usable playfield. Avoid further building up the left side without clearing lines. Future piece placements should aim to create flatter surfaces and prepare for Tetrises or multiple line clears to recover from this highly disadvantageous state.",
    "response": "thought: The board is severely imbalanced with columns C0-C3 at height 18, close to the top, and columns C4-C9 completely empty. This is a critical situation. Without explicit information on the current falling piece (its shape and orientation), I cannot plan for a specific line clear or optimal placement. However, the most urgent strategic goal is to either clear lines on the left or, failing that, to build up the right side of the board to balance it out and prevent further height increases on the left. Since I don't know the piece type to attempt a line clear, the safest general move is to begin shifting the piece towards the open, empty area on the right side of the board (columns C4-C9). A single 'RIGHT' move is a step in this direction, moving the piece away from the critically high left columns. This action sets up future placements in the empty region.\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    *   Lacking previous context, I can only assess the current snapshot. The board presents an extremely dangerous configuration: columns C0, C1, and C2 are at height 19, and C3 is at 18. This indicates a near game-over state, likely due to prolonged stacking on the left without sufficient line clears. The right side (C4-C9) is completely empty, forming a deep well.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    *   The `textual_representation` does not provide information about the last move. However, the current critical state (height 19 in three columns) suggests that recent moves have been ineffective in managing board height and preventing a top-out on the left side.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Immediate Criticality:** Columns C0, C1, C2 (height 19). Any piece placed here without clearing lines will result in game over.\n    *   **High Priority:** Column C3 (height 18) is also very high and needs attention to avoid topping out.\n    *   **Opportunity Area:** Columns C4-C9 form a vast, empty well. This is a prime location for a Tetris (4-line clear) if an 'I' piece becomes available.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Survival First:** The absolute priority is to survive by clearing lines on the left side (C0-C3). Any move that reduces height, even a single line clear, is valuable.\n    *   **Target 'I' Piece:** Monitor for an 'I' piece. If it appears, clearing a Tetris in the C4-C9 well is the most impactful move to reset board height and create breathing room.\n    *   **Avoid Raising Critical Columns:** Under no circumstances should pieces be placed in C0, C1, C2, or C3 if it increases their height without clearing lines.\n    *   **Balanced Building (Long-term):** While immediate survival is key, once the left side is slightly mitigated, the agent should aim to balance the board more effectively, or build a clear Tetris setup in the well to capitalize on future 'I' pieces. The large disparity in heights is unsustainable.",
    "response": "thought: The current game state shows an extremely dangerous situation: columns C0, C1, and C2 are at height 19, which is just one block away from a game over. Column C3 is at height 18, also critically high. The right side of the board (C4-C9) is completely empty.\n\nI do not have information on the current falling piece's shape or its initial position. Therefore, I cannot calculate a precise optimal placement for this turn. Any move that places a block in columns C0, C1, or C2 without clearing a line will result in an immediate game over. Placing a block in C3 is also very risky.\n\nGiven this critical context, the safest immediate action is to move the piece away from the high columns on the left and towards the empty area on the right. This action minimizes the risk of topping out in the current turn and allows for future planning in a less precarious position. Moving 'RIGHT' once will shift the piece at least one column away from the immediate danger zone, buying time and increasing survival chances.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "The board is nearly empty, with only the leftmost columns showing any activity. Columns 0, 1, and 2 have heights of 2, 1, and 1 respectively, forming a slight indentation at (0,1).\n\nSince there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate past moves or board changes.\n\n**Areas of the board needing attention:**\nThe overall board is very flat and open. The minor unevenness on the left (C0:2, C1:1, C2:1) creates a small 1-unit deep \"well\" in column 0. This is negligible at this stage.\n\n**Strategic insights for future moves:**\nThe primary goal should be to maintain this flatness and openness. Avoid creating new holes or building up columns too high prematurely. Keep the center columns (C3-C7) as clear as possible to allow for diverse piece placements. Without knowing the upcoming piece, specific tactical advice is difficult, but the general strategy is to build a low, flat base.\n\n**Action Reasoning:**\nSince the current falling piece type is unknown, making a specific placement (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE) would be a guess. A `HARD_DROP` is premature. `SOFT_DROP` allows the piece to descend faster, giving the AI a quicker look at its shape and potential landing spots without fully committing to a placement.\n\nSOFT_DROP",

This means columns 0, 1, and 2 have some blocks, while columns 3-9 are completely empty.\n\nThe `Aggregate Stats` array is a very long numerical vector that likely represents many different board configurations for various pieces and rotations. Without a clear mapping or a detailed description of what each number represents, it's very difficult to interpret directly for a single turn decision. It appears to encode potential future states.\n\nCrucially, the current falling piece (active piece) *is not explicitly stated* in the provided `Board Feature Summary` or `Aggregate Stats`. The `textual_representation` only shows the board state, not the piece. It also does *not* include \"N:[next_piece_ids]\".\n\nTherefore, I cannot know the shape or orientation of the current falling piece.\nGiven this lack of information about the active piece, any move other than `NO_OP` or `SOFT_DROP` would be a guess.\n\n`HARD_DROP` would immediately place the unknown piece, which could lead to a very suboptimal placement.\n`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT` would also be blind guesses about how to manipulate an unknown piece.\n\n`NO_OP` would let the piece fall one unit naturally, but `SOFT_DROP` achieves the same effect of advancing the game state and revealing the piece faster, potentially allowing for a more informed decision on the *next* turn. Since the board is mostly empty, there's no immediate danger of the piece locking at an undesirable spot from a single `SOFT_DROP`.\n\nGiven the primary goal of helping place pieces optimally, and lacking information about the current piece, the best *immediate* action is to allow the piece to descend faster to reveal its shape, which `SOFT_DROP` accomplishes. This is a common strategy when the piece type is unknown or only becomes visible after a slight descent.\nthought: The most critical piece of information missing is the type of the current falling piece. The board is largely empty, with only minor activity in columns 0-2. Since I don't know what piece is falling, I cannot intelligently choose to rotate it, move it left or right, or hard drop it. A hard drop could lead to a very bad placement if the piece is not what I expect.

This creates a significant \"well\" or \"trench\" across the majority of the board, allowing for deep drops.\n    *   **Uneven Height on Left:** Columns 0, 1, and 2 have pieces at heights 3, 3, and 4 respectively, creating an uneven left side.\n    *   **Holes (Potential):** While not explicitly stated as \"holes,\" the severe height difference implies a very non-flat surface which can lead to inefficient placements or new holes if not managed carefully.\n\n4.  **Strategic Insights for Future Moves:**\n    *   **Flattening the Board:** The immediate priority is to address the severe height disparity. The AI should aim to either bring the right side up or clear lines on the left to flatten the board. Given the extensive empty space, building up the right side is likely the most feasible initial approach.\n    *   **Utilize the Well:** The deep well provides an excellent opportunity to perform Tetris (4-line) clears by dropping straight pieces (I-blocks) down the long vertical shaft once a 4-wide flat surface is created.\n    *   **Careful Placement:** Any pieces placed should aim to contribute to creating a flatter surface or setting up for future line clears. Avoid creating new, hard-to-fill holes, especially on the left side which is already partially built up.\n    *   **Anticipate Next Pieces:** While the next piece type isn't explicitly clear from the provided stats, the AI should be ready to leverage any incoming I-blocks, L-blocks, or J-blocks to efficiently fill the deep right-side well.",
    "response": "thought: The provided game state includes the column heights `[3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, indicating that columns 3 through 9 are completely empty, forming a large well. Columns 0, 1, and 2 have existing pieces. However, the `textual_representation` and `Aggregate Stats` do not explicitly provide the shape or current spawning position of the active falling piece. This makes it impossible to determine the truly \"optimal\" move.\n\nDespite this critical lack of information, I must select one action. A `NO_OP` would allow the piece to fall without any attempt at placement. `LEFT` would likely move the piece into the existing higher structures on the left (columns 0-2), which is generally undesirable without a specific plan. `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` could be beneficial or detrimental depending on the unknown piece shape. `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would commit the piece to an unknown location, which is very risky.\n\nGiven the prominent deep well on the right side of the board, a common early-game strategy is to direct pieces towards this open area to start filling it or to prepare for larger line clears (like a Tetris using an I-piece). Assuming a standard Tetris spawn location (typically near the center-top of the board, around columns 3-6), moving the piece `RIGHT` at least once is a reasonable generic first step to guide it towards the wide-open space. This is a speculative move based on general Tetris heuristics and the visible board topography, as the active piece is not defined in the input.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context was provided, I cannot assess how the board has changed. This is the initial observation for this session.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the last move or the thought process behind it, I cannot determine its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is characterized by a significant open area occupying columns 3 through 9, which are all at height 0. The only active structure is on the left, with column heights [6, 6, 5] for C0, C1, and C2 respectively. Column 2 is slightly lower than C0 and C1, creating a small dip. The primary attention areas are:\n    *   **The Leftmost Columns (C0-C2):** These need to be managed to avoid creating holes and to maintain a relatively flat surface, or to set up for line clears.\n    *   **The Vast Empty Space (C3-C9):** This presents a massive opportunity for setting up multiple line clears, potentially a \"4-wide\" strategy if suitable long pieces (like the I-piece) are available.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize maintaining control on the left:** Focus on filling the small dip in C2 and keeping C0-C2 relatively level, or strategically building up to clear lines.\n    *   **Leverage the open right side:** This is the most dominant feature. The strategy should heavily lean towards utilizing this space for efficient line clears. Depending on the next piece, a \"4-wide\" strategy (building a vertical channel on one side and stacking pieces to fill 4 lines for simultaneous clear) is highly viable and encouraged due to the sheer amount of empty space.\n    *   **Avoid creating new holes:** Especially within the C0-C2 structure, ensure pieces are placed to fill gaps, not create new ones.\n    *   **Prepare for upcoming pieces:** The optimal move heavily depends on the `next piece` type. An I-piece would be ideal for leveraging the open columns for a quick Tetris (4-line clear). Other pieces would need to be carefully placed to either continue building the left side or start forming the \"4-wide\" channel on the right.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\nThe `textual_representation` provides the `Column Heights Vector` and a very long `Aggregate Stats` vector, but it does not explicitly state the `Next Piece Type`. Without knowing the type, orientation, or spawn position of the current falling piece, it's impossible to make a strategically sound move like `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT`, `SOFT_DROP`, or `HARD_DROP`. Any of these could lead to an undesirable placement or create holes if the piece is unknown. In a situation where crucial information (the falling piece) is missing, the safest default action is to perform no operation, implicitly waiting for a clearer game state update or for the piece to become known.\n\n**Action:**\nNO_OP",
    "response": "thought: The provided game state includes the \"Column Heights Vector\" and a long \"Aggregate Stats\" vector. However, it critically lacks information about the current *falling piece* (its type, orientation, or current position on the board). The instructions indicate that if the \"textual_representation\" shows the board as a 2D array, the active piece is already rendered on it. In this case, I only have a column height vector, which represents the *settled* board state, not a board with an active piece. Without knowing the identity of the current piece, any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) would be a blind guess and potentially detrimental. Therefore, the only safe and rational action is to perform no operation, implicitly waiting for the game state to update with the crucial piece information.\n\nmove: NO_OP",

Columns C0, C1, and C2 are built up to heights of 8, 8, and 5 respectively. Columns C3 through C9 are completely empty, presenting a wide open, flat expanse. The left side is comparatively high and could become problematic if not managed.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to take advantage of the vast empty space on the right (C3-C9). This area provides an excellent opportunity to build a flat base for easy line clears, potentially setting up for a Tetris. Efforts should focus on placing pieces to maintain this flatness and keep a single column clear (e.g., C9) for a Tetris well. Avoid adding to the height of columns C0-C2 unless it results in an immediate line clear or is absolutely necessary to prevent a hole.

The extreme height differential suggests either a failure to clear lines on the left or a continuous inability to fill the right side, leading to a dangerous, lopsided configuration.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Critical immediate attention:** The immense height difference between C2 (height 9) and C3 (height 0) is the most pressing issue. This large 'cliff' severely restricts placement options and makes it very difficult to recover.\n    *   **Left side:** Columns C0-C2 are high and need to be cleared down.\n    *   **Right side:** Columns C3-C9 are empty and need to be built up *carefully* to flatten the board. Any piece that can span the gap or build up the right without creating new holes is valuable.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Flatten the board:** The primary goal must be to reduce the height disparity. This involves either clearing lines on the left or strategically building up the right side.\n    *   **Avoid exacerbating the cliff:** Do not place pieces that make the C2/C3 height difference worse or create new holes within the empty section.\n    *   **Prioritize filling the well:** Direct upcoming pieces into columns C3-C9 to start building a base, carefully watching for opportunities to form horizontal lines that can be cleared later.\n    *   **Search for horizontal clears:** An 'I' piece would be extremely valuable if it could be oriented horizontally across the high columns (C0-C2) to clear lines and bring down the overall height.\n    *   **Consider potential for Tetrises:** Given the deep well, an 'I' piece could also be used vertically in C3 or C4 to create a 4-wide column, but this is a very long-term and risky strategy given the current height.\n    *   **Next piece awareness:** Crucially, the decision for the next move will heavily depend on the type of the *next piece*. A square (O) or L/J piece might be able to start filling the well in C3/C4, while an I-piece offers the most flexibility for line clears or spanning the gap.",
    "response": "thought: The game state indicates a severely unbalanced board with columns C0-C2 having heights 9, 10, and 9 respectively, while columns C3-C9 are completely empty. This forms a massive vertical well on the right side.

The board exhibits extreme unbalance, with columns C0-C3 significantly high (11-13 blocks) and columns C4-C9 completely empty. This suggests a pattern of plays heavily concentrated on the left side.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot evaluate the last move without prior state information. The current board state, however, presents a challenging configuration due to its severe unevenness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the entire board's balance. Columns C0-C3 are approaching critical height, especially C1-C2 at 13 blocks. Columns C4-C9 form a deep well that needs to be built up.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy must be to flatten the board. Future moves should prioritize placing pieces to build up columns C4-C9 while simultaneously attempting to clear lines from the high left side (C0-C3). Avoid further increasing the height disparities or creating new holes on the left.",

Column 2 is the highest point at 15. Conversely, the right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty. The primary area needing attention is the tall, uneven stack on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The extremely low (zero) height of columns 4-9 strongly suggests an intentional strategy to create a large well, likely for a Tetris (four-line clear) with an I-piece. Future moves should focus on:\n    *   Carefully managing the left stack, attempting to level out columns 0-3, especially reducing the height of column 2.\n    *   Maintaining the deep well on the right side, ensuring no blocks fall into it prematurely or create new holes.\n    *   Prioritizing pieces that can clear lines on the left while preserving the integrity of the right-side well, or pieces that can be stored until an I-piece arrives to capitalize on the well.\n    *   The board is getting high on the left, so line clears are becoming more urgent.",
    "response": "thought: The primary information provided is the column heights vector: `[14, 14, 15, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This clearly shows a high, uneven stack on the left side of the board (columns 0-3) and a completely empty right side (columns 4-9), indicating a setup for a Tetris clear with an I-piece. However, the critical piece of information missing from the `textual_representation` is the identity (shape and orientation) of the current falling tetromino. The problem statement explicitly mentions that the `textual_representation` typically includes a 2D array where the active piece is rendered, but this is not present. The \"Aggregate Stats\" are a long list of unlabeled numbers, from which the active piece cannot be reliably inferred. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to determine an optimal rotation or horizontal movement. Any action other than `NO_OP` would be an arbitrary guess and could lead to misplacing the piece, creating holes, or stacking too high. Therefore, the safest and most logical move is to do nothing, allowing the piece to drop one step, in the hope that the next game state observation will provide the necessary information to identify the piece.\n\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **Board Changes Since Previous States:** No previous context was provided, so I cannot assess how the board has changed or the effectiveness of past moves.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** As no previous context is available, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or the thought process behind it.\n3.  **Areas of the Board Needing Attention:** The board exhibits an extreme height disparity. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are very high (15, 16, 16), with Column 3 also significant at height 11. Conversely, Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty. This creates a large, deep well on the right side of the board. The primary area needing attention is this vast empty space (C4-C9), which represents both a significant clearing opportunity and a potential vulnerability if not managed.\n4.  **Strategic Insights for Future Moves:**\n    *   **Prioritize Filling the Well:** The immediate strategic goal should be to utilize the deep well (C4-C9) to perform line clears, ideally Tetris clears. Pieces should be directed to fill these columns from the bottom up.\n    *   **Leveling:** While the well is tempting, care must be taken not to exacerbate the height difference on the left or create new, hard-to-clear holes within the well itself. The ultimate goal is a flatter board.\n    *   **Left Side Management:** Avoid increasing the height of Columns 0-3 further unless it directly contributes to a line clear or a Tetris setup using the well. The high left side is a significant constraint.\n    *   **Piece Relevance:** Without knowing the next piece type, specific placement strategies are impossible. However, 'I', 'J', and 'L' pieces will be critical for efficiently clearing lines across the wide gap, while 'S', 'Z', and 'T' pieces will be useful for filling shallower gaps or setting up rotations.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\n\nThe current observation's \"Aggregate Stats\" does not clearly indicate the `Next Piece Type` in a human-interpretable format. Without knowing what piece is currently falling or what the next piece will be, it is impossible to make an informed strategic decision regarding horizontal movement, rotation, or committing to a `HARD_DROP`. Any specific placement action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, HARD_DROP) would be pure guesswork and highly risky.\n\nTherefore, the most responsible action is to allow the piece to descend naturally, buying time for subsequent observations that might reveal the piece type, or for internal calculations to be made once the piece's properties are known.\n\n**Action:**\nNO_OP",

However, this observation just provides a long vector of numbers without context.\n\nWithout knowing the shape of the current falling piece, its orientation, or its initial spawn position, any action other than `NO_OP` would be a blind guess. Moving `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT`, or `HARD_DROP` without this fundamental information carries a high risk of misplacement, creating holes, or topping out.\n\nThe safest and most logical action in this situation is to perform a `NO_OP`.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context provided, I cannot assess specific changes. However, analyzing the current state, the board is heavily skewed. The left four columns (C0-C3) are very high, ranging from 11 to 18 blocks. The right six columns (C4-C9) are completely empty (height 0).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous move context, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last action.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Imminent Threat (C0-C2):** Columns C0 (18), C1 (18), and C2 (17) are critically high, only 2-3 blocks away from topping out. Immediate line clears in these columns are paramount to prevent game over.\n    *   **Large Drop-off (C3-C4):** There's a severe drop from C3 (height 11) to C4 (height 0). This creates a very uneven surface, making it difficult to clear lines horizontally across the entire board.\n    *   **Empty Right Side (C4-C9):** This large empty space represents both an opportunity and a challenge. While it could be used to set up a Tetris (4-line clear), the immediate priority must be to address the left side's height.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on Left:** The primary goal is to reduce the height of C0, C1, and C2. Any piece that can contribute to a line clear in this region should be prioritized.\n    *   **Avoid Increasing Height on Left:** Placing pieces that further increase the height of C0-C2 without clearing a line would be extremely risky.\n    *   **Consider Bridging the Gap (Long-term):** Once the immediate height threat on the left is mitigated, a long-term strategy would involve gradually filling the right side (C4-C9) while simultaneously trying to level out the entire board.\n    *   **Look for I-Piece Opportunities:** If an I-piece (straight bar) is the next piece, it could be used for a 4-line clear if a suitable 4-wide gap is created on the right, but only once the left side is no longer an immediate game-over threat. Given the current state, placing an I-piece on the left would be hard to do effectively for a Tetris, and on the right it would just build up from 0.\n    *   **Maintain Awareness of Next Piece:** The specific shape of the next piece will heavily influence the optimal placement, especially with such extreme height differences.",
    "response": "thought: The provided game state presents a significant challenge because the active falling piece and its current position are not explicitly identifiable from the `Column Heights Vector` or the `Aggregate Stats` as a standard Tetromino shape. The instruction \"The board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\" typically refers to a 2D grid representation, which is not provided here. The `Column Heights Vector` only describes the *height* of each column, which could be the state after a piece has landed, or the background board. However, the available actions (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT`, `SOFT_DROP`, `HARD_DROP`) clearly indicate that a piece is currently falling and needs to be manipulated.\n\nGiven the inability to precisely determine the active piece's shape and initial spawn location, I must make a heuristic decision based on the critical aspects of the board.\n\nThe board state shows extreme unevenness:\n*   Columns C0, C1, C2 are very high (18, 18, 17 respectively), nearing the top of the board (game over height is typically 20 or 22).

While eventually useful for setting up a Tetris, this does not address the immediate, critical threat on the left.\n*   **Moving `LEFT`**: This would move the piece towards columns C0-C3, where the board is dangerously high.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate changes. However, the current board state shows a severe imbalance. The left side (columns C0-C3) is critically high, with C0 and C1 at height 19, C2 at 16, and C3 at 11. The entire right side (columns C4-C9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the last move's effectiveness is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The immediate and critical area of attention is the left side, specifically columns C0, C1, and C2, which are at game-over heights. Reducing these heights through line clears is paramount. The completely empty right side (C4-C9) also demands attention, as it presents both an opportunity for building down to clear lines and a challenge to avoid simply filling it up without addressing the left side.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be survival by clearing lines on the left. The AI should prioritize moves that reduce the height of columns C0, C1, and C2, even if they are not Tetris clears. The empty right side can be utilized to maneuver pieces and set up future clears, but care must be taken not to exacerbate the height imbalance. Building a flat base on the right while simultaneously \"digging\" down the left side is a long-term goal. Avoid placing pieces that further raise the critical left columns without an immediate line clear.",

However, the presence of available actions like LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE indicates that there is an active falling piece that needs to be controlled.\n\nGiven the dangerous height on the left side (C0, C1 at 19), any piece placed there without clearing lines will result in a game over. The entire right side (C4-C9) is completely open.\n\nSince I don't know the active piece's shape or its precise spawn location, I must choose an action that is generally safest and most likely to keep the game alive.\n1.  **Avoid the critical left side**: Moving the piece to the left (`LEFT`) would increase the risk of topping out.\n2.  **Utilize the open space**: The right side offers ample space. Moving `RIGHT` directs the piece towards this safe, open area.\n3.  **Avoid premature commitment**: `HARD_DROP` is too risky without knowing the piece or its optimal placement. `SOFT_DROP` is essentially a faster `NO_OP`.\n4.  **Rotation uncertainty**: `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` are also risky without knowing the piece's shape and how it might fit.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and safe first move, in the absence of specific piece information, is to shift the piece to the right.

There are no previous states to compare against, and the board is currently completely empty as shown by the `Column Heights Vector: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?** As this is the initial state, no moves have been made by the AI yet.\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?** The entire board is empty and available. Attention should be focused on building a stable, low, and flat foundation to maximize future line clear opportunities and avoid creating holes early on.\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?** With a completely empty board, the initial strategy is to prioritize establishing a flat base at the bottom. A common strategy is to leave a single column open (e.g., column 9) for 'I' tetrominoes to achieve Tetrises, while filling the remaining columns as evenly as possible. The very first piece should be dropped to start this foundation.\n\nReasoning for action: The board is empty, and a piece is presumably spawning at the top. The most fundamental first action is to place this initial piece onto the board to begin building. Without knowing the specific piece type or needing complex initial placement, a `HARD_DROP` is the most efficient way to achieve this, placing the piece directly at the bottom of its current column.\n\nHARD_DROP",

Columns C0 and C1 are at height 4, C2 is at height 1, and C3-C9 are entirely empty.

Utilizing the wide open space on the right (C3-C9) to create a new, flatter base or to set up for larger line clears (e.g., a Tetris well on C9) would be prudent.

The board currently features a low-height structure on the left (columns 0-2) with heights [4, 4, 5], and a completely clear, deep well across the majority of the board on the right (columns 3-9).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior move history, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or the reasoning behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The left side (columns 0-2) has a minor height difference, which could be smoothed or built upon. The most critical area, however, is the expansive, clear right side (columns 3-9), which is an excellent setup for future line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to leverage the large, empty well on the right for multiple line clears, aiming for Tetrises. Efforts should be made to maintain the openness and flatness of columns 3-9, especially by anticipating and utilizing I-pieces. Any incoming pieces can be used to incrementally clear or flatten the left-side structure (columns 0-2) without compromising the Tetris well setup. Avoid creating holes on the right.",

This is the initial state for my current reflection.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of any prior move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board presents a stark contrast:\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C3):** Features a stacked area with column heights `[7, 8, 8, 6]`. This region shows some unevenness, with C3 being the lowest at 6 and C1/C2 being the highest at 8. There are potential holes or opportunities for line clears within this region.\n    *   **Right Side (C4-C9):** This entire section is completely empty, with all column heights at `0`. This creates a very large open well.\n\n    The primary area needing attention is the **empty right side (C4-C9)**. It's a huge open space that needs to be systematically filled to level the board and prepare for future line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right well:** The most critical immediate goal is to start filling columns C4 through C9. This empty space represents both a massive opportunity for rapid line clears (especially Tetris) and a potential risk if pieces fall awkwardly into the vast emptiness.\n    *   **Utilize long pieces (I-blocks):** I-blocks (straight pieces) would be exceptionally valuable for quickly building up the height in the empty columns, allowing for efficient line clears.\n    *   **Build a flat surface:** As pieces are placed on the right, aim to create a relatively flat surface to facilitate future placements and Tetris opportunities. Avoid creating new deep holes or overhangs in this currently pristine area.\n    *   **Monitor left side, but focus right:** While building on the right, keep an eye on the existing stack on the left. If a piece offers a good fit to level out the `[7, 8, 8, 6]` area without compromising the right-side build, consider it. However, the empty right side is the dominant strategic consideration.\n    *   **Next piece:** The `Aggregate Stats` provide a long vector, but the specific encoding for \"Next Piece Type\" is not immediately decipherable without a key. Knowing the next piece would refine the placement strategy significantly.",

The prompt's instruction to \"determine its shape and position\" from the available information is challenging here, as neither the `Column Heights Vector` nor the `Aggregate Stats` (without a clear key) allow for this deduction. The statement \"the board shown already includes the active piece\" is contradictory with \"plan the optimal next move\" if the piece has already landed. I must assume the vector represents the base board and a piece is currently falling from a standard spawn position (typically centered, e.g., columns 3-6).\n\nGiven the absence of explicit active piece information, I must choose a move that is generally optimal for most pieces in this board configuration. The most obvious strategic goal is to utilize the deep well on the right side of the board to clear lines and maintain a low stack. Moving the current piece towards this open area is the best initial step. A single `RIGHT` action will shift the piece one column to the right from its likely central spawn position, guiding it towards the empty C4-C9 region.

This creates a very large, deep well on the right.\n\nA critical piece of information, the type and orientation of the active falling piece, is not explicitly provided in the `textual_representation`. The prompt's instruction to \"determine its shape and position\" from the available information is challenging here, as neither the `Column Heights Vector` nor the `Aggregate Stats` (without a clear key) allow for this deduction. The statement \"the board shown already includes the active piece\" is contradictory with \"plan the optimal next move\" if the piece has already landed. I must assume the vector represents the base board and a piece is currently falling from a standard spawn position (typically centered, e.g., columns 3-6).\n\nGiven the absence of explicit active piece information, I must choose a move that is generally optimal for most pieces in this board configuration. The most obvious strategic goal is to utilize the deep well on the right side of the board to clear lines and maintain a low stack. Moving the current piece towards this open area is the best initial step. A single `RIGHT` action will shift the piece one column to the right from its likely central spawn position, guiding it towards the empty C4-C9 region. Rotating the piece without knowing its shape is a gamble, and moving `LEFT` would direct it towards the already higher stack on the board.",

However, the current state indicates a significant height disparity has developed or persisted.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Given no previous context, the effectiveness of the last move cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the right side of the board (columns C4-C9), which is completely empty. The left side (C0-C3) is significantly higher, reaching up to 13 lines. This creates a large, deep well between C3 (height 11) and C4 (height 0). This imbalance is a primary concern.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate priority should be to balance the board by building up the empty right side (C4-C9). This will reduce the severe height differential and provide more options for future line clears. Avoid building higher on the already tall left side (C0-C3) unless it results in an immediate line clear that significantly lowers the height in those columns. Focus on filling the right-hand gap efficiently.",

Columns C0-C2 are very high (16, 16, 17), while C3 is at height 11, and C4-C9 are completely empty. This creates a deep and wide valley on the right side, with a precarious wall on the left.

Pieces should be directed towards building up the empty columns C4-C9 to reduce the massive height discrepancy. Care must be taken to not exacerbate the height on the already tall C0-C2 columns or create new holes. Focus on building a flat surface in the mid-board to enable future line clears.",

Given the severe imbalance and the immediate need to address the deep well on the right side (columns C4-C9), moving *any* piece towards that empty area is generally a safer first step than moving it towards the already dangerously high left side (C0-C2). Rotations are also risky without knowing the piece.

Columns C0 through C3 are built up to height 18 (assuming a standard 20-row board), leaving very little room at the top. In stark contrast, columns C4 through C9 are completely empty. This creates an extremely severe height differential and a massive, deep well across the right half of the board. The left side (C0-C3) is dangerously close to the game-over line.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate priority is survival. With columns C0-C3 at height 18, any further build-up there without clearing lines will lead to game over quickly.\n    *   **Prioritize line clears:** Focus on clearing lines on the left side (C0-C3) to reduce the height.\n    *   **Address the well cautiously:** While the well in C4-C9 presents a large empty space, mindlessly filling it without considering the left side's height will likely result in a game over.\n    *   **Avoid creating holes:** As pieces are placed, especially in the empty right section, ensure stable foundations are built to avoid creating new holes that are difficult to fill.\n    *   The current state is highly precarious; every move must be evaluated for its immediate impact on line clearing potential and avoiding topping out on the left.",

    "reflection": "This is the first observation, so previous context for board changes and last move effectiveness is unavailable.\n\n**Current Board State Analysis:**\nThe board is in a critical state. Columns C0 and C1 are at height 19, and C2 and C3 are at height 18. This means the left quarter of the board is nearly full, leaving very little room for any incoming pieces, and is likely on the verge of a game over. In stark contrast, columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0), indicating a massive, unused open space on the right side of the board.\n\n**Areas of the board needing attention:**\nThe immediate and most pressing area is the left side (C0-C3), which is at maximum or near-maximum height. Any piece placed there without clearing lines will likely result in a game over. The vast empty space on the right (C4-C9) also needs attention, as it represents both the potential for a massive collapse if not managed and the only real available space for current and future pieces.\n\n**Strategic Insights for future moves:**\n1.  **Survival Priority:** The primary goal is to survive this critical state. Without knowing the current falling piece, it's impossible to recommend a specific placement, but any move that *avoids* increasing the height of C0-C3 is paramount.\n2.  **Utilize Open Space:** If the current piece can be moved to the completely empty columns (C4-C9), it must be placed there to buy time and create a base, even if it creates an imperfect stack.\n3.  **Line Clear Impossible (Likely):** Given the extreme height difference, forming a Tetris (4-line clear) or even a multi-line clear seems highly improbable, as the pieces would need to fit precisely into the high left side.\n4.  **Careful Placement:** Hard drops are extremely risky; soft dropping might be necessary to carefully maneuver a piece into any minuscule available gap on the left, or to safely position it within the wide-open right section.\n\nThe board is highly unbalanced and on the precipice of a game over. The focus must be on immediate survival by any means necessary, likely by using the empty columns on the right.",

This means the left side of the board is extremely dangerous, and any piece placed there without clearing lines will likely result in a game over. The only safe area to place pieces is on the right side of the board.\n\nCrucially, the prompt does not explicitly state the shape or current position of the active falling piece. Without this information, it's impossible to plan an optimal rotation or a precise placement for line clearing. However, I must choose an action.\n\nGiven the extreme imbalance of the board, the primary goal is survival, which means moving the active piece away from the high left side and towards the empty right side. Assuming a standard Tetris spawn position (typically near the center, e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7), a `RIGHT` move will shift the piece away from the critical columns (0-3) and towards the safe, empty columns (4-9). This is the most logical and least risky single action to take in an unknown piece state, aiming for immediate survival by utilizing the available space.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

The board is largely clear, with minimal height in the leftmost three columns (C0: 2, C1: 1, C2: 1) and the remaining seven columns (C3-C9) completely empty.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** No previous moves are available for evaluation.\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:** The board is very clean, presenting a good starting state. The low heights in C0-C2 create a slight leftward bias, but it's easily manageable. The primary \"attention\" needed is to utilize the vast empty space (C3-C9) effectively.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:** The current state is excellent for establishing a strong foundation. Focus on maintaining a flat, low profile across the board. Begin by filling in the empty columns (C3-C9) to even out the board's height. This wide open space is also conducive to setting up a vertical well for future Tetris (4-line) clears, likely in one of the rightmost columns.",

However, if rotated twice (to Rotation 2, an \"upside-down T\"), it can fill C3-C5, resulting in heights [..., 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...], which is much flatter and sets up a better foundation. Achieving Rotation 2 requires two rotation actions. Since only one action can be performed per turn, the immediate optimal move is to initiate this rotation.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I will describe the current state as a new observation. The board shows a clear separation: the left side (C0-C3) has significant height and structure, with C0 and C1 at height 7, C2 at 6, and C3 at 3. The right side (C4-C9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or thought process.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The large, empty expanse on the right side (C4-C9) is the primary area for attention, presenting a blank canvas for building. On the left, columns C0, C1, and C2 are approaching critical heights and will need careful management to prevent topping out. The well created by C3 (at height 3) might require filling.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy should be to utilize the completely open right side of the board (C4-C9) to create a flat, low-lying base. This will allow for easy line clears and prevent the game from ending prematurely due to uncontrolled height on the left. Pieces should primarily be placed on the right, gradually building up. Once a base is established, look for opportunities to clear lines on the left, prioritizing reducing the height of C0, C1, and C2. Maintaining a low overall height and avoiding new holes in the structured left side is crucial.",
    "response": "thought: I am unable to determine the current falling piece, its shape, or its current position from the provided \"Board Feature Summary\" and \"Aggregate Stats\". The \"Board Feature Summary\" only provides column heights, which represent the static settled blocks, not the active piece. The \"Aggregate Stats\" string is too abstract to infer the piece without a specific decoding key.\n\nGiven this critical information deficit, I cannot plan an \"optimal\" move based on the piece's properties or its best placement for line clears. However, I must choose an action.\n\nLooking at the overall board structure, columns C0-C3 have varying heights (7, 7, 6, 3), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). A general strategy in Tetris is to keep the board as flat and low as possible, especially utilizing large open areas. The right side of the board (C4-C9) presents a perfect opportunity to build a flat base.\n\nAssuming the unknown piece spawns near the center of the board, a single `RIGHT` move would begin shifting it towards this large empty area on the right. This is a speculative move, but it's the most logical choice given the board's topology and the lack of specific piece information. Moving `LEFT` would push it towards the already high and complex left side. Rotating an unknown piece is also highly risky. Therefore, moving `RIGHT` is the safest initial action to position any piece towards the most favorable part of the board.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

Look for opportunities to clear lines on the left to bring down the overall height.\n    *   The vast empty space on the right (C4-C9) is a blank canvas.

Columns C0-C2 are significantly high (10-11), while C3 is very low (3). Columns C4-C9 are completely empty, creating a vast, deep well on the right side. The primary area of concern is the high stack on the left (C0-C2) and the dramatic drop-off.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy should focus on utilizing the expansive empty space on the right (C4-C9) to build a flat base and clear lines. The goal is to reduce the height of the left columns (C0-C2). Avoid further building on the high left side without an immediate line clear. Prioritize placing pieces to create horizontal lines across the board, particularly focusing on bringing down the height on the left and filling in the C3 dip as opportunities arise without creating new holes. A balanced, flat build on the right side will provide maximum flexibility for upcoming pieces.",

My primary objective is to clear lines and flatten the board, especially by utilizing the open space on the right.\n\nUnfortunately, the textual representation does not explicitly state the active falling piece or its current orientation/position in a human-readable grid format. The \"Aggregate Stats\" are too complex to parse for this information directly without a key. Therefore, I must make a strategic decision based on the general board state.\n\nGiven the deep well and completely empty space on the right (columns C4-C9), the most logical and versatile first move for almost any piece, regardless of its shape or initial orientation, is to shift it towards the right. This will position the piece over the lowest available ground, allowing for more flexible placement options to start building a new, flat base in the empty region, or to set up for future line clears. Moving right will also keep the piece away from the high stack on the left, preventing further stacking in that area.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "This board state presents a significant challenge due to extreme imbalance.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, direct comparison is impossible. However, the current state itself shows a drastic change or accumulation: a very deep, wide well has formed on the right side (columns C4-C9 are completely empty), while the left side (C0-C2) is quite high (12-13). There's a severe drop-off after C2, creating a 10-unit height difference to C3. This suggests either a very inefficient long-term strategy that accumulated on the left, or a recent sequence of moves that cleared extensively from the right, or simply never built on the right.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot determine without knowledge of the last move or the previous state. However, if the last move contributed to this dramatic height disparity, it was likely counterproductive to maintaining a balanced board.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Critical:** The vast empty space in columns C4-C9 is the primary focus. This offers a huge opportunity but also indicates a dangerous structural flaw if not addressed.\n    *   **Urgent:** The steep drop between C2 (height 13) and C3 (height 3). This deep pit needs to be filled efficiently to allow for future line clears.\n    *   **Secondary:** The high columns C0-C2 (heights 12-13) are nearing the top of the board and limit future placement options.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right-side well (C4-C9) and the C3 pit.** The immediate goal should be to build up these empty columns to create a more level playing field.\n    *   **Seek line clears.** With such a large empty area, there is high potential for multiple line clears (doubles, triples, or even a Tetris) if appropriate pieces become available.\n    *   **Avoid exacerbating the imbalance.** Do not place pieces on the left side (C0-C2) unless absolutely necessary for an immediate clear or if no other viable options exist.\n    *   **Look for I-blocks (straight pieces) to span the C3 gap or clear multiple lines on the right.** This board is primed for a large multi-line clear if the right pieces are delivered.\n    *   Maintain a mental map of future piece placements to ensure the new structures on the right are flat and clearable.",
    "response": "thought: The game state shows a highly unbalanced board. Columns C0, C1, C2 are high (12, 13, 13), C3 has a low height of 3, and columns C4 through C9 are completely empty.

The priority is to fill this empty space (C4-C9) and the deep pit in C3, while avoiding further stacking on the already high left side (C0-C2).\n\nA critical piece of information, the `active falling piece type`, is not explicitly provided in the `textual_representation`. The `Aggregate Stats` is a long list of numbers without a key, making it impossible to reliably deduce the active piece type from it.

However, I must choose one of the available actions.\n\nConsidering the board state, moving any piece towards the left would be detrimental, as it would likely increase the height of the already high columns or exacerbate existing holes. Moving the piece to the right is the most robust general strategy in this situation. It directs the piece towards the vast empty region (C4-C9) where blocks are needed to level out the board and create potential for line clears. Assuming a standard spawn location (typically near the center, e.g., columns 3-5), a `RIGHT` move would shift the piece away from the high left side and closer to the desirable empty columns. `NO_OP` would drop the piece without repositioning, which could be suboptimal depending on the unknown piece's shape and spawn position. `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` are also speculative without knowing the piece shape and how its rotation would interact with the board. Therefore, `RIGHT` is the most logical and beneficial single step to take given the current board imbalance and lack of information about the active piece.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

The board currently shows a severe imbalance: columns C0-C3 are at a significant height (14 units), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty (0 units).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous observations or knowledge of the last executed move, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the dramatic drop-off from column C3 (height 14) to C4 (height 0). This creates a very high left wall and an entirely empty right side. The entire left side (C0-C3) needs attention to reduce its height, and the right side (C4-C9) needs to be built up evenly to avoid creating further inaccessible gaps.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to flatten the board. Prioritize placing pieces in the empty columns (C4-C9) to build a foundation and reduce the height differential. Avoid adding to the height of C0-C3 unless it results in an immediate line clear. Look for pieces that can bridge the height gap (e.g., 'Z' or 'S' pieces rotated, or 'L' and 'J' pieces) to create line clear opportunities on the left or to begin filling the right. This board state presents a significant recovery challenge due to the extreme disparity in column heights.",

The \"Board Feature Summary\" only provides column heights. Without knowing the active piece, its shape, and its starting drop column, it is impossible to determine an *optimal* rotation or precise horizontal placement.\n\nHowever, I must select an action. Assuming the active piece spawns somewhere near the top-middle, and given the goal of filling the empty right side of the board, the most logical first action is to move the piece to the right. This action starts the process of positioning the piece over the low-lying columns (C4-C9), which is where new blocks need to be placed to balance the board. Any other specific rotation or movement without knowing the piece would be entirely random or potentially counterproductive. `RIGHT` is the most general move towards the strategic area.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    *   As there is no previous context, I must infer the state's evolution. The current board presents a drastic imbalance: columns 0-3 are relatively high (14-16 units), while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This indicates a highly lopsided build, likely from consistently placing pieces on the left side or successfully clearing lines *only* on the right side over many previous turns.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    *   Without prior context, it's impossible to evaluate the last move directly. However, the current board state, with its extreme height disparity, suggests that recent strategic choices have led to an inefficient and potentially risky configuration. While the empty right side offers flexibility, the high left side limits future placement options significantly.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Right Side (C4-C9):** This vast, empty space is the most critical area. It needs to be filled strategically to create a stable base and lower the overall board height.\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C3):** These columns are high. While they provide an opportunity for large line clears if the right side can be built up quickly, they are also a potential game-over threat if not managed carefully. Avoid increasing their height without immediate line-clearing potential.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize building on the right:** Focus all efforts on filling columns 4-9. The goal is to create a more balanced and lower board profile.\n    *   **Establish a Tetris well:** Given the open space, immediately begin forming a single-column Tetris well on column C9 or C8. This will allow for efficient use of I-pieces to clear multiple lines once a base is established.\n    *   **Careful piece placement:** Every incoming piece should be evaluated for its potential to contribute to the right-side build or the Tetris well, while strictly avoiding placements that deepen holes or needlessly increase height on the already tall left side.\n    *   **Maintain flatness on the right:** As the right side is built, strive for a flat surface to facilitate future placements and efficient line clears.\n\nThis board state offers a challenge but also a significant opportunity to reset with a strong Tetris well setup.",

The provided \"Aggregate Stats\" and other sections do not clearly indicate the shape or rotation of the *current falling piece* or the *next piece*. This makes it impossible to plan an optimal move with certainty.\n\nHowever, I must choose an action. Given the extreme board imbalance, the overarching strategy must be to direct pieces to the right side (columns 4-9) to fill the empty space and create a more balanced board. Placing any piece on the left side would further increase the height in an already dangerous area. Therefore, assuming the piece is falling somewhere in the middle or left (default spawn), moving it to the right is the only logical general action to attempt to utilize the open space, despite not knowing the piece's shape. Rotating without knowing the piece is also random, and NO_OP would simply let it fall without any strategic input.

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    With no previous context provided, I cannot precisely track changes. However, the lengthy \"Aggregate Stats\" string suggests a persistent pattern where the left side of the board (C0-C3) has been significantly built up while the right side (C4-C9) remains largely, if not entirely, empty. The current `Column Heights Vector [18, 18, 16, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` confirms this severe imbalance.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    I cannot determine the last move or its effectiveness without access to that information. However, the current board state indicates a problematic accumulation of blocks on the left, which suggests that previous placements have either not effectively cleared lines or have contributed to this imbalance.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **High Columns (C0-C3):** These columns are critically high (up to 18 rows). The risk of topping out is imminent if pieces continue to be placed here without line clears.\n    *   **Empty Well (C4-C9):** The entire right half of the board is completely empty, forming a deep well. This represents both a significant challenge due to the imbalance and a massive opportunity for aggressive line clears.\n    *   **Overall Imbalance:** The disparity in height across the board is extreme and is the primary concern.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Leveling and Line Clears:** The immediate and critical goal is to reduce the height of the left side and level out the board. This can only be achieved by strategically placing pieces to form full lines that extend across the entire board, especially utilizing the empty right side.\n    *   **Utilize the Right Well:** Any incoming pieces should primarily be directed towards filling the empty columns (C4-C9) to gradually build up this section and create opportunities for line clears.\n    *   **Avoid Building Left:** Unless absolutely essential for a line clear, no more pieces should be added to columns C0-C3, as this will hasten a game over.\n    *   **I-Piece Strategy (if applicable):** An I-piece could be highly effective if placed vertically in the right-side well, potentially clearing multiple lines once the other columns are built up to a suitable level.\n    *   **Missing Information:** A crucial piece of information, the `Current Piece Type` (the falling piece), is missing. Without knowing its shape and orientation, precise optimal placement cannot be determined.\n\n---\n\n**Action:**\nGiven the critical imbalance and the entirely open right side, the most generally beneficial *initial* action, in the absence of knowing the current falling piece, is to guide it towards the open area.\n\nHARD_DROP",

However, based on the `Column Heights Vector: [18, 18, 16, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is severely imbalanced. The left side is dangerously high (columns 0-3), and the entire right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty. The strategic imperative is to avoid placing blocks on the left and to start filling the empty right well. Assuming the piece spawns near the center, a `RIGHT` move is the most sensible first step to guide any falling piece towards the lower, empty columns on the right side of the board. This minimizes the risk of topping out on the left and moves towards utilizing the vast open space.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context provided, so I cannot assess how the board has changed.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the last move's effectiveness or its underlying thought process is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a critical state. Columns 0, 1, 2 are extremely high (18, 19, 19), nearing the top. Column 3 is also high at 14. Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (0 height). This creates an extreme imbalance, with a deep chasm on the right side and the left side almost topped out. The primary area needing attention is the entire board, specifically building up the right-hand side (C4-C9) to level the playing field and avoid an immediate game over on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy must focus on survival and leveling the board.\n    *   **Fill the void:** Prioritize pieces that can efficiently build up columns 4-9. This might involve dropping pieces into the rightmost empty columns or using horizontal pieces to bridge gaps.\n    *   **Avoid the left:** Placing pieces in columns 0, 1, 2 should be avoided unless absolutely necessary to clear lines, as they are already dangerously high.\n    *   **Line Clear Challenge:** Given the immense height difference, achieving line clears will be extremely challenging. Focus on creating a stable base on the right before attempting large line clears.\n    *   **Piece Management:** The exact next piece is crucial. If an 'I' piece comes, it could potentially clear a line on the high left side or be used horizontally to build a significant chunk on the right. Other pieces will require careful placement to contribute to filling the void without creating further holes.\n    *   The current situation is highly unstable and requires precise, deliberate placement to avoid losing immediately.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context provided, so this appears to be a fresh or reset board state. The current board is very low, with only the leftmost columns (C0-C2) containing pieces at heights [2, 1, 1] respectively. The rest of the board (C3-C9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the effectiveness of a \"last move\" is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board currently has a slight unevenness on the left, with C0 being 2 blocks high and C1, C2 being 1 block high. While this is a minor deviation due to the low overall height, the primary attention should be on maintaining a flat surface as new pieces are introduced. Avoid creating new holes in the early game.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The board is largely open and low. The current strategy should focus on:\n    *   **Maintaining flatness:** Prioritize placements that keep the top surface as level as possible to maximize future placement options and prevent early holes.\n    *   **Building a well:** Begin to establish a clean stacking pattern, potentially leaving a single column open on one side (usually C9) for a future Tetris (4-line clear).\n    *   **Avoiding holes:** With so much empty space, it's crucial to place pieces carefully to prevent enclosed gaps.",
    "response": "thought: The current game state shows a very low board. The column heights are [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means columns 0, 1, and 2 have some blocks, and the rest are empty.\n\nThe `Aggregate Stats` array is quite long and complex. It appears to be an encoded representation of possible piece placements and their resulting board states/scores. To interpret this effectively, I need to know the current falling piece. Unfortunately, the `textual_representation` only provides column heights and aggregate stats, but not the *current active piece*. This is a critical missing piece of information.\n\nHowever, given the constraint of *one action per step* and the fact that I don't know the current piece, I need to make a general move that is usually safe or sets up for future flexibility.\n\nIf the board description \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" *already includes* the active piece, then it means the piece has just landed or is about to land, and the listed heights are the result. This interpretation seems unlikely, as usually the active piece is separate.\n\nLet's assume the `Column Heights Vector` refers to the *settled* pieces, and there's an active piece somewhere. Without knowing the active piece, making a \"perfect\" move is impossible.\n\nIf this is a \"blind\" move, a `NO_OP` is usually the safest if no piece information is given, allowing the piece to fall naturally to reveal its shape and position. However, if the system *expects* an action that moves the piece, a `NO_OP` might just make it drop prematurely without good placement.\n\nLooking at the format: `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` This looks like a list of encoded features/scores for *all possible placements* of the *current piece*. The sheer length suggests it covers many different piece types, rotations, and positions.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the prompt: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" The primary representation is the `Board Feature Summary` and `Aggregate Stats`. There's no explicit `active_piece` or `next_piece_ids`.\n\nIf I *must* choose an action without knowing the piece, I should choose one that is generally neutral or sets up a common good strategy.\n- Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` without knowing the piece's initial spawn position could be problematic.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` is also risky without knowing the piece's shape and current orientation.\n- `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would commit the piece, which is dangerous without placement knowledge.\n\nThe `Aggregate Stats` list is the key. It's a list of `features` for *all possible placements*. The challenge is, how do I extract the *best* placement from this list without knowing the piece type and its possible states? The `Aggregate Stats` seems to contain multiple scenarios. Each set of `[Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, ...]` likely represents a possible outcome. The structure `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` might be a sequence of `(holes, roughness, lines_cleared, score_delta, piece_type, rotation, x_position)` for each possible drop.\n\nIf I interpret the initial `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` as the *current state with the active piece not yet landed*, and I don't know the active piece, I am truly blind.\n\nHowever, the \"Reflection on Past\" section mentions: \"The board currently has a slight unevenness on the left, with C0 being 2 blocks high and C1, C2 being 1 block high.\" This refers to the *settled* board state.\n\nLet's assume the `Aggregate Stats` array is a pre-calculated list of features for possible outcomes, and I need to pick the \"best\" one, which then implies the move.\nA common way to encode this is `(score_for_placement_1, rotation_for_placement_1, x_position_for_placement_1, score_for_placement_2, rotation_for_placement_2, x_position_for_placement_2, ...)`.\nThe list starts with `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 0, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]`.\n\nThis long list of numbers for `Aggregate Stats` needs a clear definition to be interpreted. Without a legend for what each number represents, or how to chunk it, it's very difficult to use.\nHowever, if I assume it is a sequence of `(holes, aggregate_height, cleared_lines, bumpiness, current_piece_type, current_piece_rotation, current_piece_x_position, current_piece_y_position, ...)` or some similar heuristic values for *every possible drop location/rotation combination for the current piece*, then I would need to find the \"best\" entry in that list.\n\nSince the prompt explicitly says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move\", and provides a long `Aggregate Stats` array, it's highly probable that this array *encodes* all the information needed, including the current piece and optimal move. Without knowing the encoding, however, it's guesswork.\n\nLet's look at the example response format: `move: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)`. The frame count implies I am acting on *this specific frame*, not making a final hard drop.\n\nIf I *must* interpret the `Aggregate Stats` to determine a move, I need a heuristic. A common heuristic for Tetris is to minimize height, clear lines, and avoid holes.\nThe `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, ...]` suggests that `2` might be the number of holes, `0` the roughness, `2` the lines cleared, `1` the \"piece type\", `3` the \"rotation\", `0` the `x` position, and then more zeros before the next set of features. This would imply the `Aggregate Stats` is a sequence of `(holes, roughness, lines_cleared, current_piece_type, current_piece_rotation, current_piece_x_position, ...)` for all possible placements. This is still too ambiguous.\n\nLet's assume the prompt implies that the \"optimal next move\" is one of the `Available Actions` (NO_OP, LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) to manipulate the *current piece*, and the board state is the *background* board.\n\nSince there is no \"Next Piece Type\" explicitly given in the `Board Feature Summary` or as a separate field, I cannot tell what piece I am currently manipulating. The `Aggregate Stats` also do not explicitly state \"Next Piece Type\" in an easily digestible way. The prompt's \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)\" is misleading if the `Next Piece Type` isn't clearly separated.\n\nGiven the almost empty board (heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), the primary goal is usually to keep the board flat and prepare for a Tetris clear. This means building up the sides, generally leaving one column open.\n\nSince I don't know the piece, the safest \"first move\" when the board is largely empty and I have no piece info is often to position the piece toward the center or a side, but without a piece, I can't even tell which direction.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`.\"\n`textual_representation` is provided. It contains `Board Feature Summary` and `Aggregate Stats`. It does NOT contain `active_piece` or `next_pieces_ids`.\n\nThis is a critical lack of information. I cannot determine the \"optimal next move\" if I don't know *what piece* I am moving.\n\nIf I am forced to pick *one* action, and I have absolutely no information about the current piece, then:\n- `NO_OP` just lets it fall one step. If the piece is already near the bottom, this might be a bad idea. If it's at the top, it's neutral.\n- `LEFT` / `RIGHT`: Risk moving it to a bad spot without knowledge.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` / `ROTATE_RIGHT`: Risk rotating it into an unusable state.\n- `SOFT_DROP` / `HARD_DROP`: Definitely bad without knowing the piece and destination.\n\nHowever, the instructions also say: \"Infer from `textual_representation`\". And the example response has `move: (right, 1)`. This implies a specific action for a specific piece.\n\nWhat if the first few numbers in `Aggregate Stats` somehow encode the *current piece* or the *optimal first action*?\n`[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]`\nPerhaps `1` refers to a piece type (e.g., I-piece), and `3` refers to its rotation, `0` its x-position. This is purely speculative and not grounded in any provided legend.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n1. I must output one action from the list.\n2. I have no explicit current piece info.\n3. The board is mostly empty.\n\nLet's look at the `Aggregate Stats` one more time. It's a very long array. This kind of array is typically used in a reinforcement learning context where the agent is given the raw feature vector and trained to output an action. I, as an LLM, don't have that training or a legend to decode it.\n\nIf the prompt expects me to \"infer\" from the `textual_representation`, and the only complex part is `Aggregate Stats`, then it must contain the information about the piece and optimal move. But *how*? Without a schema, it's impossible.\n\nI will have to make an educated guess based on common Tetris strategies for an empty board.\nA good general strategy is to start building a flat base, usually leaving a well on one side (e.g., column 9) for future I-pieces. To do this, pieces often need to move `RIGHT` or `LEFT` and occasionally rotate.\n\nSince the board is so low and clear, a `NO_OP` is likely the safest *first* step if I don't know the piece and where it spawns. It allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its shape or default position if the `textual_representation` updates.\n\nHowever, the prompt is \"plan the optimal next move\", implying a decisive action. If I don't know the piece, any move other than `NO_OP` is pure speculation.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the *current piece* information is embedded in the `Aggregate Stats` as a feature. For example, if the first `3` in `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, ...]` refers to a \"piece type\" and the following `0` a \"rotation\" and then another `0` for an \"x-position\". This is a common representation.\n\nIf I cannot deduce the piece, I cannot deduce the optimal placement. I will assume the prompt *expects* me to deduce the piece and its optimal placement from the `Aggregate Stats`. This is a hard problem without a mapping.\n\nLet's assume the problem setter expects a move that progresses the game. A `NO_OP` is technically a move but doesn't position the piece.\n\nGiven the problem setup (AI assistant playing Tetris, goal is optimal placement), and the format of `Aggregate Stats`, it's plausible this is a feature vector from an RL agent. In such a scenario, the `Aggregate Stats` would include features that allow a model to determine the next best action. Without the model or feature definitions, I am essentially trying to reverse-engineer a black box.\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the current piece, I cannot plan an optimal placement. The board is nearly empty. The heights are `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This implies some blocks are already on the left side.\n\nWhat if the first few numbers `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` represent a series of `(score_change, lines_cleared, holes, aggregate_height, bumpiness, current_piece_ID, current_piece_rotation, current_piece_x_position, current_piece_y_position)` for the *best possible move* for the current piece?\nIf this is the case, I need to know the structure.\nAssuming a common structure for \"optimal move encoding\":\n`[lines_cleared, holes, aggregate_height, bumpiness, piece_id, rotation, x_position]`\nThe first segment `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` is too long for one placement.\nWhat if `[2, 0, 2]` are (holes, roughness, lines cleared) for one placement. Then `1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0` are piece, rotation, x, y, etc.\nThis is pure speculation.\n\nLet's consider the initial state `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. It's a low board with a small indentation on C1 and C2.\nIf the active piece is, for example, an O-piece, placing it at C3 would maintain flatness. If it's an I-piece, it could be rotated and placed on C0-C3 or C6-C9.\nWithout knowing the piece, I cannot perform \"optimal placement\".\n\nThe most reasonable interpretation in such an information-scarce situation, given the prompt expects an \"optimal next move,\" is that *the information needed to derive that move is implicitly present in the Aggregate Stats in a way I cannot decode*.\n\nTherefore, I have to rely on general Tetris principles for an empty board.\n1. Clear lines.\n2. Avoid holes.\n3. Keep the board flat.\n4. Prepare for future Tetrises (leave a column open).\n\nGiven that I can only execute *one* action at a time, and the board is very low, it's highly unlikely that a single `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`, or `LEFT`/`RIGHT` would be a *final* optimal placement. These are intermediate steps.\n`HARD_DROP` is out of the question without knowing the piece and destination. `SOFT_DROP` is similar.\nSo it must be `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT`, or `NO_OP`.\n\nIf the \"next piece type\" is indeed encoded in the `Aggregate Stats`, I cannot find it.\nLet's make a very safe, generally useful first move for an arbitrary piece, aiming to build a flat base. Often, moving a piece towards the center or right is a common first step to begin building a well on column 9 or 0.\n\nGiven the board starts with `[2, 1, 1, ...]` on the left, it might be beneficial to move pieces to the right to balance the board.\nIf a piece spawns in the center (which is common), moving `RIGHT` once or twice is a good initial step.\n\nI am forced to pick *some* action. Without the piece, it's impossible to claim any action is \"optimal\". But if I must act, I'll pick a move that is a common early game manipulation. Moving `RIGHT` once is a very common first move to position for most pieces, especially if the default spawn is slightly left of center, or if the board needs to be built up on the right.\nThis is a guess, but it's a guess based on general Tetris game flow when piece information is missing.\n\nI acknowledge the significant lack of information about the active piece and the meaning of the `Aggregate Stats`. My chosen action is a best guess under severe uncertainty, prioritizing a typical initial positioning maneuver for an empty board.\nI will assume the board shown is the *background*, and an *unknown piece* is falling from the top-center.\nMoving `RIGHT` is a reasonable initial adjustment for many pieces to begin building a flat base from left-to-right, or to leave space for a Tetris column on the far right.\nthought: The primary challenge in analyzing this game state is the lack of explicit information about the current falling piece. The `Board Feature Summary` provides column heights for the settled blocks `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, showing a very low and mostly empty board with some blocks on the left. The `Aggregate Stats` is a long, complex array of numbers, which without a clear legend or schema, cannot be reliably decoded to identify the current piece or its optimal placement. It likely contains pre-calculated features for all possible placements, but I lack the means to interpret it.\n\nGiven these constraints, I cannot determine a truly \"optimal\" move. I must choose an action from the `Available Actions` list based on general Tetris principles for an early, empty board, assuming an unknown piece is currently falling from a default spawn position (usually near the top-center).\n\nCommon strategies for an empty board include:\n1.  **Maintaining flatness:** Avoid creating holes or large height discrepancies.\n2.  **Building a well:** Often, players build up a flat surface while leaving one column (usually column 0 or 9) clear for I-pieces to achieve Tetrises.\n\nSince the board is almost empty, any single action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE\\_LEFT, ROTATE\\_RIGHT) is an *intermediate step* in positioning a piece, not a final placement. `HARD_DROP` and `SOFT_DROP` are too committal without knowing the piece. `NO_OP` just lets the piece fall one step, which might be safest if truly blind, but doesn't actively contribute to positioning.\n\nIf a piece spawns in the center, a common initial move is to shift it to one side to begin building. The board currently has blocks on C0-C2. Moving pieces to the right side (C3-C9) is a common strategy to build a flat base and prepare a Tetris well on C0, or to utilize the empty space. A single `RIGHT` move is a reasonable, generally safe initial adjustment for many pieces, allowing for subsequent rotations or further horizontal movement. This provides flexibility and begins to shift potential piece placements away from the already slightly higher left side, towards the vast empty space on the right.\n\nmove: RIGHT",
    "thought": "The current game state shows a very low board. The column heights are [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means columns 0, 1, and 2 have some blocks, and the rest are empty.\n\nThe `Aggregate Stats` array is quite long and complex. It appears to be an encoded representation of possible piece placements and their resulting board states/scores. To interpret this effectively, I need to know the current falling piece. Unfortunately, the `textual_representation` only provides column heights and aggregate stats, but not the *current active piece*. This is a critical missing piece of information.\n\nHowever, given the constraint of *one action per step* and the fact that I don't know the current piece, I need to make a general move that is usually safe or sets up for future flexibility.\n\nIf the board description \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" *already includes* the active piece, then it means the piece has just landed or is about to land, and the listed heights are the result. This interpretation seems unlikely, as usually the active piece is separate.\n\nLet's assume the `Column Heights Vector` refers to the *settled* pieces, and there's an active piece somewhere. Without knowing the active piece, making a \"perfect\" move is impossible.\n\nIf this is a \"blind\" move, a `NO_OP` is usually the safest if no piece information is given, allowing the piece to fall naturally to reveal its shape and position. However, if the system *expects* an action that moves the piece, a `NO_OP` might just make it drop prematurely without good placement.\n\nLooking at the format: `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` This looks like a list of encoded features/scores for *all possible placements* of the *current piece*. The sheer length suggests it covers many different piece types, rotations, and positions.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the prompt: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" The primary representation is the `Board Feature Summary` and `Aggregate Stats`. There's no explicit `active_piece` or `next_piece_ids`.\n\nIf I *must* choose an action without knowing the piece, I should choose one that is generally neutral or sets up a common good strategy.\n- Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` without knowing the piece's initial spawn position could be problematic.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` is also risky without knowing the piece's shape and current orientation.\n- `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would commit the piece, which is dangerous without placement knowledge.\n\nThe `Aggregate Stats` list is the key. It's a list of `features` for *all possible placements*. The challenge is, how do I extract the *best* placement from this list without knowing the piece type and its possible states? The `Aggregate Stats` seems to contain multiple scenarios. Each set of `[Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, ...]` likely represents a possible outcome. The structure `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]` might be a sequence of `(holes, roughness, lines_cleared, score_delta, piece_type, rotation, x_position)` for each possible drop.\n\nIf I interpret the initial `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` as the *current state with the active piece not yet landed*, and I don't know the active piece, I am truly blind.\n\nHowever, the \"Reflection on Past\" section mentions: \"The board currently has a slight unevenness on the left, with C0 being 2 blocks high and C1, C2 being 1 block high.\" This refers to the *settled* board state.\n\nLet's assume the `Aggregate Stats` array is a pre-calculated list of features for possible outcomes, and I need to pick the \"best\" one, which then implies the move.\nA common way to encode this is `(score_for_placement_1, rotation_for_placement_1, x_position_for_placement_1, score_for_placement_2, rotation_for_placement_2, x_position_for_placement_2, ...)`.\nThe list starts with `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 0, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]`.\n\nThis long list of numbers for `Aggregate Stats` needs a clear definition to be interpreted. Without a legend for what each number represents, or how to chunk it, it's very difficult to use.\nHowever, if I assume it is a sequence of `(holes, aggregate_height, cleared_lines, bumpiness, current_piece_type, current_piece_rotation, current_piece_x_position, current_piece_y_position, ...)` or some similar heuristic values for *every possible drop location/rotation combination for the current piece*, then I would need to find the \"best\" entry in that list.\n\nSince the prompt explicitly says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move\", and provides a long `Aggregate Stats` array, it's highly probable that this array *encodes* all the information needed, including the current piece and optimal move. Without knowing the encoding, however, it's guesswork.\n\nLet's look at the example response format: `move: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)`. The frame count implies I am acting on *this specific frame*, not making a final hard drop.\n\nIf I *must* interpret the `Aggregate Stats` to determine a move, I need a heuristic. A common heuristic for Tetris is to minimize height, clear lines, and avoid holes.\nThe `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, ...]` suggests that `2` might be the number of holes, `0` the roughness, `2` the lines cleared, `1` the \"piece type\", `3` the \"rotation\", `0` the `x` position, and then more zeros before the next set of features. This would imply the `Aggregate Stats` is a sequence of `(holes, roughness, lines_cleared, current_piece_type, current_piece_rotation, current_piece_x_position, ...)` for all possible placements. This is still too ambiguous.\n\nLet's assume the prompt implies that the \"optimal next move\" is one of the `Available Actions` (NO_OP, LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) to manipulate the *current piece*, and the board state is the *background* board.\n\nSince there is no \"Next Piece Type\" explicitly given in the `Board Feature Summary` or as a separate field, I cannot tell what piece I am currently manipulating. The `Aggregate Stats` also do not explicitly state \"Next Piece Type\" in an easily digestible way. The prompt's \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)\" is misleading if the `Next Piece Type` isn't clearly separated.\n\nGiven the almost empty board (heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), the primary goal is usually to keep the board flat and prepare for a Tetris clear. This means building up the sides, generally leaving one column open.\n\nSince I don't know the piece, the safest \"first move\" when the board is largely empty and I have no piece info is often to position the piece toward the center or a side, but without a piece, I can't even tell which direction.\n\nThe instructions say: \"If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`.\"\n`textual_representation` is provided. It contains `Board Feature Summary` and `Aggregate Stats`. It does NOT contain `active_piece` or `next_pieces_ids`.\n\nThis is a critical lack of information. I cannot determine the \"optimal next move\" if I don't know *what piece* I am moving.\n\nIf I am forced to pick *one* action, and I have absolutely no information about the current piece, then:\n- `NO_OP` just lets it fall one step. If the piece is already near the bottom, this might be a bad idea. If it's at the top, it's neutral.\n- `LEFT` / `RIGHT`: Risk moving it to a bad spot without knowledge.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` / `ROTATE_RIGHT`: Risk rotating it into an unusable state.\n- `SOFT_DROP` / `HARD_DROP`: Definitely bad without knowing the piece and destination.\n\nHowever, the instructions also say: \"Infer from `textual_representation`\". And the example response has `move: (right, 1)`. This implies a specific action for a specific piece.\n\nWhat if the first few numbers in `Aggregate Stats` somehow encode the *current piece* or the *optimal first action*?\n`[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, ...]`\nPerhaps `1` refers to a piece type (e.g., I-piece), and `3` refers to its rotation, `0` its x-position. This is purely speculative and not grounded in any provided legend.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n1. I must output one action from the list.\n2. I have no explicit current piece info.\n3. The board is mostly empty.\n\nLet's look at the `Aggregate Stats` one more time. It's a very long array. This kind of array is typically used in a reinforcement learning context where the agent is given the raw feature vector and trained to output an action. I, as an LLM, don't have that training or a legend to decode it.\n\nIf the prompt expects me to \"infer\" from the `textual_representation`, and the only complex part is `Aggregate Stats`, then it must contain the information about the piece and optimal move. But *how*? Without a schema, it's impossible.\n\nI will have to make an educated guess based on common Tetris strategies for an empty board.\nA good general strategy is to start building a flat base, usually leaving a well on one side (e.g., column 9) for future I-pieces. To do this, pieces often need to move `RIGHT` or `LEFT` and occasionally rotate.\n\nSince the board is so low and clear, a `NO_OP` is likely the safest *first* step if I don't know the piece and where it spawns. It allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its shape or default position if the `textual_representation` updates.\n\nHowever, the prompt is \"plan the optimal next move\", implying a decisive action. If I don't know the piece, any move other than `NO_OP` is pure speculation.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the *current piece* information is embedded in the `Aggregate Stats` as a feature. For example, if the first `3` in `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, ...]` refers to a \"piece type\" and the following `0` a \"rotation\" and then another `0` for an \"x-position\". This is a common representation.\n\nIf I cannot deduce the piece, I cannot deduce the optimal placement. I will assume the prompt *expects* me to deduce the piece and its optimal placement from the `Aggregate Stats`. This is a hard problem without a mapping.\n\nLet's assume the problem setter expects a move that progresses the game. A `NO_OP` is technically a move but doesn't position the piece.\n\nGiven the problem setup (AI assistant playing Tetris, goal is optimal placement), and the format of `Aggregate Stats`, it's plausible this is a feature vector from an RL agent. In such a scenario, the `Aggregate Stats` would include features that allow a model to determine the next best action. Without the model or feature definitions, I am essentially trying to reverse-engineer a black box.\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the current piece, I cannot plan an optimal placement.

I must choose an action from the `Available Actions` list based on general Tetris principles for an early, empty board, assuming an unknown piece is currently falling from a default spawn position (usually near the top-center).\n\nCommon strategies for an empty board include:\n1.  **Maintaining flatness:** Avoid creating holes or large height discrepancies.\n2.  **Building a well:** Often, players build up a flat surface while leaving one column (usually column 0 or 9) clear for I-pieces to achieve Tetrises.\n\nSince the board is almost empty, any single action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE\\_LEFT, ROTATE\\_RIGHT) is an *intermediate step* in positioning a piece, not a final placement. `HARD_DROP` and `SOFT_DROP` are too committal without knowing the piece. `NO_OP` just lets the piece fall one step, which might be safest if truly blind, but doesn't actively contribute to positioning.\n\nIf a piece spawns in the center, a common initial move is to shift it to one side to begin building. The board currently has blocks on C0-C2. Moving pieces to the right side (C3-C9) is a common strategy to build a flat base and prepare a Tetris well on C0, or to utilize the empty space. A single `RIGHT` move is a reasonable, generally safe initial adjustment for many pieces, allowing for subsequent rotations or further horizontal movement. This provides flexibility and begins to shift potential piece placements away from the already slightly higher left side, towards the vast empty space on the right.",

This wide open space provides excellent opportunities to place most incoming pieces without creating immediate holes or significant height discrepancies.

This large, deep well is an excellent opportunity for clearing lines, but also creates significant height disparity across the board. The left wall (C0-C3) needs to be managed to prevent it from growing too high or developing internal holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current priority should be to efficiently fill the deep well in columns C4-C9. Aim to build up these columns while maintaining a clear potential line-clear path at the bottom. Long I-pieces will be incredibly valuable here for Tetris clears. Avoid creating new holes, especially in the existing C0-C3 wall, and try to keep the overall board profile as flat as possible as the right side rises.",

We need to decide whether to clear lines on the left, start building a clean base on the right, or attempt to set up a Tetris well.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The most prominent feature is the large, flat, empty space on the right (C4-C9). This presents an excellent opportunity to build cleanly. Future pieces should ideally be placed to:\n    *   **Level out the left side:** Prioritize pieces that can fill gaps or clear lines on the left (C0-C3).\n    *   **Utilize the right side for a clean base:** Start building a flat, low structure on the right to prepare for future line clears or a potential Tetris.\n    *   **Consider a Tetris setup:** Given the completely empty right half, it's an ideal opportunity to establish a Tetris well (e.g., in C9 or C0) if an I-piece is anticipated or can be saved for. The immediate priority is to avoid creating further deep holes on the left and to begin to address the significant height discrepancy.",

Any piece, regardless of its shape, needs to be steered away from the already high left side and towards the empty right side to start building a balanced foundation or set up a Tetris well.\n\nTherefore, moving the piece one step to the right is the most appropriate first action.

What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe board is severely unbalanced. Columns C0-C3 are elevated (max height 11), while columns C4-C9 are entirely empty. This creates a significant drop-off and a large, deep well on the right side of the board.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe primary strategy should be to capitalize on the vast empty space on the right (C4-C9). Future moves should prioritize directing pieces to this area to build a flat base and level the board, ideally setting up for a Tetris (4-line clear) by keeping one column (e.g., C9) clear for an 'I' piece. Care should be taken not to exacerbate the height on the left (C0-C3) or create new holes there.",

The strategic goal is to fill the empty right side of the board to create a flatter surface and set up future line clears, possibly a Tetris. Without knowing the current piece's type or its exact initial position (as it's not explicitly stated in the primary representation, and the visual representation is N/A), the most sensible first move is to shift the piece towards the empty region. Moving `RIGHT` will achieve this, allowing the piece to potentially fall into columns C4-C9, which is the immediate priority for board leveling.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

These columns are dangerously close to the top and are the primary focus for line clears.\n    *   **Mid-Height (C3):** Column 3 is at a moderate height (5 blocks). While not immediately critical, it breaks the massive empty space.\n    *   **Massive Empty Space (C4-C9):** Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **Board Changes:** As there is no previous context, I cannot directly comment on how the board has changed. However, the current board state shows activity only on the far left, with column heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The rest of the board is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Without information on the last move or the piece placed, its effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:**\n    *   The left side (columns 0, 1, 2) is the only area with blocks. Column 0 is currently the highest at 2, with columns 1 and 2 at height 1. This forms a slight unevenness that should be addressed to flatten the board.\n    *   The vast empty space from column 3 to 9 represents a blank canvas. Care must be taken to maintain flatness and avoid creating early holes in this area.\n\n4.  **Strategic Insights:**\n    *   **Flattening:** The immediate priority should be to level out the existing pieces on the left to create a flat surface, ideally by placing a piece that fills column 1 or 2 to match column 0's height.\n    *   **Maintain Low Height:** The board is very low, which is ideal. Continue to keep the overall height minimal to maximize reaction time and future options.\n    *   **Build Foundation:** Begin forming a solid, flat foundation across the entire board, or strategically create a single-column well on the far right (C9 or C8) for future Tetris opportunities, while keeping the rest of the board as flat as possible.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** Given the current low state, avoid creating any new holes, especially in the empty right section, as this will complicate future placements.",
    "response": "thought: The current game state provides a board feature summary indicating column heights: C0=2, C1=1, C2=1, and all other columns (C3-C9) are at height 0. This means there's a small structure on the left side of the board with a dip in columns 1 and 2. The aggregate stats are too complex to parse for the active piece information without a schema. Therefore, I must infer the best move based on the column heights and general Tetris strategy.\n\nThe immediate strategic goal, as noted in the reflection, should be to \"level out the existing pieces on the left\" by filling the gaps in columns 1 and 2 to match column 0's height of 2. Assuming the active piece spawns near the center of the board (e.g., columns 3-6), moving it to the left is the most logical first step to bring it closer to the existing structure and allow for potential placement in columns 1 or 2. Without knowing the piece type or its current rotation, a horizontal movement to get the piece into the general target area is a safer initial action than a blind rotation. Moving `RIGHT` would move the piece further away from the existing stack and into the completely empty right side of the board, which is less optimal for addressing the immediate unevenness.\n\nmove: LEFT",

This indicates that all previous pieces have been placed exclusively on the left side of the board.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Without previous context, the effectiveness of the last move cannot be assessed.\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:** The most critical area is the massive empty space spanning columns C3-C9. This deep well represents a significant imbalance and a potential trap if pieces are not directed there soon. While C0-C2 are not excessively high, continuing to build there without addressing the right side will lead to an unrecoverable situation.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:** Future moves must prioritize filling the large gap in columns C3-C9. Pieces that can span multiple columns (like the I-piece or long L/J pieces) should be saved for this purpose or strategically placed to begin leveling the board. The goal is to bring the empty columns up to a similar height as the left side, or at least start building a foundation to do so. Avoiding further vertical growth on C0-C2 is also important unless it results in a line clear that also helps distribute blocks more evenly.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    I lack previous context to compare against. Therefore, I cannot ascertain how the board has changed or if the last move was effective.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous observations or knowledge of the last action taken, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is severely imbalanced. Columns C0-C2 are very high (9, 10, 9), putting the game at risk of topping out on the left side. Conversely, columns C3-C9 are completely empty (0 height). This creates a critical situation where the left is dangerously high and the right is an enormous, unused void.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Immediate Priority: Board Balance & Line Clears.** The most critical task is to bring down the height of columns C0-C2. Look for opportunities to clear lines on the left side with incoming pieces.\n    *   **Fill the Void:** Simultaneously, begin to build up the right side (C3-C9). This large empty space needs to be utilized to create a more stable and balanced board structure.\n    *   **Avoid Left-Side Building:** Do not place any new pieces that would increase the height of columns C0-C2 unless it guarantees an immediate line clear that significantly reduces the height.\n    *   **Tetris Opportunity:** The completely empty right side presents an ideal setup for a potential Tetris if an I-piece becomes available after some initial building to create a well (e.g., filling C3-C8 and keeping C9 clear). However, immediate balance and height reduction are paramount.",
    "response": "thought: The primary challenge in this game state is the severe imbalance of the board. Columns C0, C1, and C2 are dangerously high (9, 10, 9 respectively), while columns C3 through C9 are completely empty (0 height). This makes the board susceptible to topping out on the left side.\n\nA critical piece of information, the current active falling piece, is unfortunately not explicitly stated in the provided `textual_representation`. The \"Aggregate Stats\" only mentions a \"Next Piece Type\" (value 11, which is not standard and thus uninterpretable without a key). The \"Board Feature Summary\" provides only column heights of the *settled* pieces, not an active piece's location.\n\nGiven this lack of information about the active piece, I cannot determine the \"optimal\" move in the strictest sense, as the best move highly depends on the piece's shape and initial orientation. However, I must choose *one* action from the available list.\n\nConsidering the board's condition, the most important strategic goals are:\n1.  **Reduce height on the left (C0-C2):** Clear lines to bring down the stack.\n2.  **Build up the right (C3-C9):** Utilize the vast empty space to create a more balanced board and potential for Tetrises.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, I cannot evaluate if it can immediately clear a line on the left. Therefore, the safest general strategy, as a first step, is to move any incoming piece away from the congested left side and towards the empty right side. Most pieces spawn near the center of the board (e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7 for a 10-wide board). Moving `RIGHT` would shift the piece further into the empty columns (C3-C9), initiating the process of filling that void and maintaining distance from the high left side.\n\nMoving `LEFT` would likely exacerbate the height problem on the left. `NO_OP`, `SOFT_DROP`, or `HARD_DROP` would drop the piece in its unknown current spawn position, which is unlikely to be ideal given the board's imbalance. Rotations are also impossible to determine without knowing the piece.\n\nTherefore, `RIGHT` is the most logical heuristic initial action to address the severe board imbalance, by directing the unknown piece towards the available space, and away from the dangerously high columns.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

This reflection is based solely on the current observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the effectiveness of a last move is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is severely imbalanced. Columns C0, C1, C2, and C3 are all at height 11. Conversely, columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a massive, deep well on the right side of the board. The immediate priority is to address this imbalance.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategic objective must be to **fill the empty columns (C4-C9)**. Placing pieces on the already high left side (C0-C3) should be avoided unless absolutely necessary for specific line clearing opportunities (which are not present now) or if the piece cannot fit elsewhere. Focus on dropping pieces into the right-hand well to begin leveling the board and create a playable surface for future line clears. Failure to address this deep well will severely limit future placement options and lead to an early game over as pieces stack up on the left.",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context available, so I cannot determine how the board has changed. This is the initial observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior moves or context, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of any previous action.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is severely unbalanced. Columns C0-C3 are significantly high (11-13 blocks), while columns C4-C9 are completely empty. This creates a large, deep well on the right side of the board. The left side is nearing the top, but the right side offers ample space.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate priority must be to build up the right side of the board (columns C4-C9) to even out the height distribution. Dropping pieces into this large empty space will be crucial. We need to avoid making the left side (C0-C3) any taller if possible, as it's already quite high. The goal is to create horizontal lines that can eventually clear across the entire board once the right side is built up.",

This indicates a severe imbalance on the board. My immediate goal should be to move the current falling piece towards the empty right side of the board to begin filling it up and evening out the height. Without knowing the exact piece or its current rotation, the most universally beneficial first step is to move the piece to the right. This positions it away from the danger zone on the left and towards the open area, allowing for subsequent moves to place it effectively.\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "The current game state presents a challenging asymmetry. With no previous context available, I can only assess the board as it stands.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without prior states, I observe the current board has accumulated significant height on its left side. Columns C0, C1, and C2 are at heights 15, 16, and 16 respectively, pushing dangerously close to the top of the playfield. Column C3 acts as a transitional height at 11. Most notably, columns C4 through C9 are completely empty, forming a large, deep well on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Unable to determine, as there's no information on the last move or the thought process behind it. However, the resulting board state indicates a need to address the severe height imbalance.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Immediate Concern:** The high left side (C0-C2) is critical. Further buildup here could quickly lead to a game over. Prioritizing line clears on this side is essential.\n    *   **Strategic Opportunity:** The vast empty space on the right (C4-C9) represents a major opportunity. It needs to be filled efficiently to create a stable base, ideally setting up for multiple line clears (e.g., a Tetris).\n    *   **Transition:** Column C3 needs to be managed to smooth the transition between the high left and the empty right.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The overarching strategy must be to lower the left side and build up the right side simultaneously, aiming to create a flatter surface for easier play. This will likely involve:\n    *   Prioritizing pieces that can clear lines on the left.\n    *   Using pieces to start filling the right-side well, building from the bottom up.\n    *   Avoiding placing pieces that further exacerbate the height difference or create new holes on the left.\n    *   The `Next Piece Type` (though not explicitly parsed from the aggregate stats) will be crucial in determining the optimal placement and rotation for each piece to achieve these goals.\n\nGiven the current board state, and without knowledge of the falling piece, a default action is difficult to specify optimally. However, to begin addressing the massive empty space and prepare for any incoming piece, it's generally beneficial to try to move pieces towards the open area.\n\n**Action:** RIGHT",
    "response": "thought: The primary information available is the column heights: [15, 16, 16, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This indicates a very high left side of the board (columns 0-2) and a completely empty right side (columns 4-9). Column 3 is a transition point. Crucially, the current falling piece (active piece) is **not specified** in the provided \"Current Game State\" or \"Aggregate Stats\". Without knowing the active piece, its shape, and its current rotation/position, it's impossible to plan an truly optimal move.\n\nHowever, I am required to provide an action. Given the large empty well on the right side of the board (columns 4-9), a common strategy is to try to direct incoming pieces towards this area to fill it up and create a flat base, aiming for line clears. Assuming the active piece spawns somewhere in the middle columns (e.g., C3-C6), moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable first step to begin shifting it towards the unoccupied right half of the board. This is a generic directional move, making the most sense when the piece type is unknown, but a large open space exists on one side.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

However, the current board state shows a severe imbalance.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is critically imbalanced. The left side (columns C0-C3) is very high, with C0 and C1 at height 18. The right side (columns C4-C9) is completely empty. This creates a massive gap and a deep well starting from C4. The immediate concern is the extreme height on the left, which is close to topping out.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The priority must be to reduce the height on the left side, ideally by clearing lines that involve columns C0-C3. Simultaneously, pieces should be directed towards filling the deep well on the right (C4-C9) to balance the board. I-pieces would be exceptionally valuable for clearing multiple lines at once in the rightmost columns. Avoid further building up the left side, especially columns C0 and C1, without clearing lines.",

However, the immediate priority must be to prevent further stacking on columns C0-C2, which are dangerously high. Placing any piece there without clearing lines will likely result in a game over.\n\nThe safest available area is the entirely empty right side of the board (C4-C9). Therefore, the most general protective action, in the absence of piece information, is to move the unknown piece towards this empty region. This will avoid exacerbating the critical height on the left and potentially allow it to start filling the well. Moving right one step is the first action towards this goal.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

The most striking feature is the extreme height difference:\n    *   **Left Side (Columns 0-3):** Extremely high, with C0 and C1 at height 19 (near the top). C2 is at 17, and C3 is at 11. This area is very close to topping out.\n    *   **Right Side (Columns 4-9):** Completely empty.\n    *   **Roughness/Holes:** The massive drop-off from C3 (height 11) to C4 (height 0) represents extreme unevenness. While there are no visible 'holes' within the stacked left side from this high-level view, the overall board state is highly precarious due to the height on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate priority is survival.\n    *   **Clear the Left:** Focus efforts on clearing lines on the left side (C0-C3) to reduce the critical height, especially C0 and C1.\n    *   **Utilize the Right with Caution:** The completely empty right side (C4-C9) offers immense space. While tempting, blindly filling it without a plan will only shift the problem. Pieces should be placed to create a stable, low-profile base that can eventually be used to clear lines or smooth out the board.\n    *   **Avoid Further Height Imbalance:** Do not place pieces on the left that will increase C0 or C1's height if a line clear isn't imminent.\n    *   **Prioritize Flatness:** Work towards flattening the overall board, even if it means building up the right side gradually to create a stable foundation for future tetrises. Given the current state, even modest line clears on the left are crucial.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Given the \"Previous Context: None,\" a direct comparison is not possible. However, the `Column Heights Vector` explicitly shows `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, indicating a completely empty board. This is either the very start of a new game or the result of highly effective previous moves that led to a full board clear. The presence of many non-zero values in the \"Aggregate Stats\" is puzzling if the board is truly empty; I will proceed with the assumption that the `Column Heights Vector` is the accurate representation of current physical heights, implying a pristine state.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without context on the last move, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness. However, the *current state* of a completely empty board is highly advantageous. If this state was achieved through gameplay, it represents excellent execution.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Since the board is entirely empty, no specific areas require clearing or hole-filling. The immediate attention shifts to the strategic placement of the *next* incoming piece on this blank canvas.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Build a flat foundation:** With an empty board, the primary objective is to maintain a low and flat profile to maximize future placement flexibility.\n    *   **Prepare for Tetris:** This is the ideal opportunity to begin building a well for a future Tetris (4-line clear) by keeping one of the side columns clear (e.g., Column 9).\n    *   **Avoid creating holes:** Creating holes at this stage would be a significant early game error and should be strictly avoided.\n    *   **Prioritize options:** Every placement should consider how it impacts subsequent piece placements, aiming to keep as many options open as possible.\n\n**Action:** Given the lack of a current piece or immediate requirement, and assuming a new piece will soon appear, for the purpose of a general AI, I will assume it's waiting for a piece drop and not actively moving. However, if forced to choose an action *now* with an empty board and no piece, `NO_OP` is the only logical choice. If a piece is implicitly falling, a more specific placement action would be needed based on that piece.\n\nConsidering the format, I will output an action, assuming no piece is currently active, and the AI is waiting for input:\nNO_OP",

    "reflection": "*   **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context is provided, a direct comparison is not possible. However, the current board state is exceptionally low and clear, with column heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates either a very early game stage or a highly effective sequence of line clears.\n\n*   **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without the previous observation, the last move cannot be precisely evaluated. Nevertheless, the resulting board state is excellent: very low overall height, no immediate holes, and a relatively flat profile. This strongly suggests that recent moves have been effective in maintaining a clean and manageable board.\n\n*   **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a very strong position. The main \"areas for attention\" involve continuing to build carefully. Specifically:\n    1.  **Minor Height Discrepancy:** Column 0 is at height 2, while Columns 1 and 2 are at height 1. Leveling these out would further improve flatness.\n    2.  **Empty Columns:** Columns 3 through 9 are completely empty. Future pieces should be used to build these up, ideally in a flat manner, creating a wider base.\n\n*   **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    1.  **Prioritize Flatness:** Aim to fill Columns 1 and 2 to height 2 to match Column 0, or use incoming pieces to build up the empty right side (C3-C9) while maintaining a low and even profile.\n    2.  **Avoid Holes:** With such a clean board, preventing the creation of new holes is paramount to maintaining this strong state.\n    3.  **Prepare for Line Clears:** While the board is low, always be looking for opportunities to set up single, double, or even triple line clears as pieces come, rather than just stacking aimlessly.\n    4.  **Flexible Stacking:** Given the open space, remain flexible in piece placement, avoiding committing to deep wells unless a perfect piece for a line clear is available or imminent.",
    "response": "thought: The board is very clean, with column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means there's a small depression at columns 1 and 2. The `Aggregate Stats` section contains information about the next piece. I need to parse the `Aggregate Stats` to find the `Next Piece Type`.

Without a key, it's hard to reliably identify the current falling piece. However, from the trajectory, it states \"Past 10 turn(s) game trajectory (each turn an unique hash)\". This suggests I'm looking at a single turn, and the `textual_representation` of the board state *already includes the active piece*.\n\nLet's reconstruct the board implied by the column heights:\nRow 0 (bottom): X X X . . . . . . .\nRow 1:           X . . . . . . . . .\nRow 2:           . . . . . . . . . . (empty)\n\nThe heights are [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means:\nCol 0 has 2 blocks.\nCol 1 has 1 block.\nCol 2 has 1 block.\nCols 3-9 have 0 blocks.\n\nThis means there's a structure like this:\n```\n....\nXX..\nX X.\n```\nThis is a bit ambiguous as to what piece formed it. Since no active piece or next piece is explicitly stated other than the `textual_representation` of the *current board state*, I will assume the `Column Heights Vector` *includes* the falling piece in its current \"soft dropped\" or \"hard dropped\" state. If the prompt intended me to know the *active* piece, it would have been provided as `active_piece` or `next_piece_type` in a decipherable format.\n\nGiven the prompt's instruction: \"the board shown already includes the active piece\", and \"Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", this is the resulting board state *after* the current piece has landed.\n\nThe goal is to `plan the optimal next move` and `output one action string`. This implies there *is* a current falling piece that I need to place. The primary representation `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` seems to be the *landing state* or the *board before the current piece has been decided*.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" \"The board shown already includes the active piece.\" This is contradictory. The `Column Heights Vector` describes a *landed* state, or a board *without* an active falling piece, if it is to be followed by an action.\n\nIf the `Column Heights Vector` is the state *before* the current piece falls, then there's a problem: I don't know the current piece.\nIf the `Column Heights Vector` is the state *after* the current piece has landed, then there's no `next move` for *this* piece, only for the *next* piece.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation: I am given a board state and *a current falling piece that is implicitly shown on the board*. The problem is that the `Column Heights Vector` `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` doesn't show an active falling piece, but rather the *landed* state of previous pieces.\n\nThe Aggregate Stats part is extremely long and hard to parse. It is usually structured data like `[holes, roughness, next_piece_type, ...]` but here it's just a long list of numbers. Without a schema, interpreting `next_piece_type` is impossible.\n\nGiven the limitations:\n1. I don't know the active piece.\n2. The board state `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` seems to be the *static* board.\n\nThis situation requires making an assumption about the missing information.\n**Assumption 1: The prompt is incomplete, and I need an active piece to make a move.**\n**Assumption 2: The `Column Heights Vector` represents the board *before* the current piece, and I have to *guess* the current piece based on the aggregate stats, or assume it's a generic \"next piece\".**\n**Assumption 3: The `Column Heights Vector` is the *result* of the previous piece landing, and I need to make a `NO_OP` to signal that it's waiting for a new piece.** (This contradicts \"plan the optimal next move\" for *a piece*).\n**Assumption 4: I need to simulate a \"typical\" piece (e.g., a square O-piece or a straight I-piece) and place it optimally given the board.** (This is speculative and not based on the prompt).\n\nLet's look at the example: \"The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation suggests I need to move it right by two positions...\". This implies that the `textual_representation` *should* contain the active piece. The provided `textual_representation` for this turn is:\n`Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n`Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [...]`\n\nThere is *no* explicit mention of the active piece's shape or position in the `textual_representation`. The `Column Heights Vector` *only* describes the heights of *landed* blocks. It cannot describe a *falling* piece.\n\nThis is a critical gap in information. I cannot determine the \"optimal next move\" for an unknown piece.\n\nHowever, the problem requires me to provide *an* action.\nWhat if the problem expects me to parse the \"Aggregate Stats\" for \"Next Piece Type\"? It says \"Next Piece Type, etc.\". This suggests \"Next Piece Type\" is one of the features in that long vector. Given the vector is 338 elements long, parsing it without a mapping is impossible.\n\nLet me consider the most common Tetris piece, which is often the I-piece or the O-piece.\nIf it's an I-piece (straight line), a good default strategy for a flat board is to lay it flat (IIII).\nIf it's an O-piece (square), it's always placed as a square.\n\nGiven the current board heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is relatively low.\nThe \"valley\" is at columns 1 and 2.\n- Placing an I-piece horizontally (IIII):\n  - If placed at C0-C3: Fills C0 to 2+1=3, C1 to 1+1=2, C2 to 1+1=2, C3 to 0+1=1. Height: [3,2,2,1,...]. Not ideal for the valley.\n  - If placed at C1-C4: Fills C1 to 1+1=2, C2 to 1+1=2, C3 to 0+1=1, C4 to 0+1=1. Height: [2,2,2,1,1,...]. This would level columns 1 and 2 with 0. This seems good.\n- Placing an I-piece vertically:\n  - If placed at C0: C0 to 2+4=6. Bad.\n  - If placed at C1: C1 to 1+4=5. Bad.\n  - If placed at C2: C2 to 1+4=5. Bad.\n- Placing an O-piece (square):\n  - At C0-C1: Fills C0 to 2+2=4, C1 to 1+2=3. Bad.\n  - At C1-C2: Fills C1 to 1+2=3, C2 to 1+2=3. Bad.\n  - At C2-C3: Fills C2 to 1+2=3, C3 to 0+2=2. Bad.\n  - At C3-C4: Fills C3 to 0+2=2, C4 to 0+2=2. Height: [2,1,1,2,2,...]. This starts building the right side flat. This is a decent move if it's an O.\n\nSince I don't know the piece, any action I choose would be a guess. However, I *must* choose an action.\nThe prompt mentions \"the board shown already includes the active piece.\" If this is strictly true, then `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` *is* the board *with* the active piece, meaning the piece has landed or is about to land at this configuration. This would imply `NO_OP` or `HARD_DROP` if it's already there. But if it's already landed, `HARD_DROP` does nothing. `NO_OP` would mean waiting for the next piece.\n\nThis interpretation would mean I'm being asked what to do *after* this piece has been placed. But the action is for the *current* piece. This is a logical inconsistency in the prompt's instructions.\n\nLet's re-read \"If using `textual_representation`, remember the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\"\nIf the `Column Heights Vector` is `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and it includes the active piece, then the active piece *must* be part of that structure.\nFor instance, if the original board was `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` and the current piece is some shape that formed `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, then this piece has effectively landed.\n\nBut `Column Heights Vector` describes the *filled* cells, not cells that are part of a falling piece. Typically, a textual board representation *shows* empty cells with '.', landed cells with 'X' or other symbols, and the falling piece with distinct symbols. A vector of heights is inherently a *landed* state.\n\nI'm forced to assume that \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector\" is the *base* board, and there's a new piece starting to fall.\nSince I cannot determine the piece, I cannot determine the \"optimal next move\".\nHowever, the system *requires* an action.\n\nWhat's a generally safe first move if you don't know the piece?\n- `NO_OP`: Could be safe, but doesn't progress.\n- `LEFT`/`RIGHT`: Could move the piece to an undesirable position.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT`/`ROTATE_RIGHT`: Could make the piece worse or better.\n\nThe game is not high. Heights are [2,1,1,...]. So there's no immediate danger of stacking out. This means `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` is not immediately critical. `HARD_DROP` would just place an unknown piece in an unknown, possibly bad, default position.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that \"Aggregate Stats\" holds the current piece. The example prompt says \"Next Piece Type\", which implies a future piece. If there was a \"Current Piece Type\" it would be more helpful.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the absolute requirement to output *one* action string:\n1. I cannot determine the active piece.\n2. The board is very low and open.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, a rotational move or a horizontal move is purely speculative. A `NO_OP` is the safest choice *if the current piece is truly unknown*. It signals \"I'm not making a decision yet on placement because I lack information, hoping to gather more or for the piece to become clear.\"\n\nIf I *must* guess a piece and act, an I-piece is very common. Assuming an I-piece spawns at the top center. Default spawn is usually columns 3-6 or 4-7.\nCurrent board: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe \"valley\" is at columns 1-2. To fill this valley, an I-piece would ideally be rotated and then moved.\nIf an I-piece is falling, it might spawn horizontally at `_ _ _ I I I I _ _ _` (cols 3-6).\nTo fill C1 and C2, I would want to move it left and potentially rotate.\nIf it's an I-piece, and it's horizontally oriented, moving it to fill C1-C4 (`_ X X X X _ _ _ _ _`) would create `[2,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. This looks like a reasonable option.\nTo achieve this from a default spawn position (e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7), it would require moving LEFT.\nIf the piece spawns at C3, moving left would make it C2. Then another left to C1. So, 2 LEFT moves.\nSo, if I assume it's an I-piece, and I want to fill the valley in C1-C2, my first move would likely be `LEFT`.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an I-piece and spawns horizontally at the standard center (e.g., columns 3-6).\nBoard:\n`[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nSpawned I-piece: `....IIII..` (cols 3-6)\nDesired outcome: `..IIII....` (cols 1-4) which would fill C1 and C2 to height 2 and build C3 and C4 to height 1. This would flatten the board.\nTo get from C3-C6 to C1-C4, I need to move it LEFT twice.\nSo the first move should be `LEFT`.\n\nWhat if the piece is a T-piece?\nSpawn T: `...T.TTT...` (top block C4, base C3-C5).\nTo fill the valley (C1,C2), rotating and moving would be complex. A flat T (T T T T) might fill C0-C2.\nIf it's a T, moving left might be to stack on C0 or C1.\n\nGiven the extreme lack of piece information, the instruction \"plan the optimal next move\" is almost unanswerable.\nHowever, if there is *any* move to make, it's usually to position for the eventual drop.\nA common first move if you're trying to move a piece left (e.g., to put it into a 'well' on the left side, or fill gaps like C1/C2) is `LEFT`.\n\nLet's review the problem's example for `textual_representation` use:\n\"The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation shows it near the top left.\"\nThis implies that the `textual_representation` *should* contain the piece shape, perhaps in an ascii art form, or a clear \"Current Piece: L\" string. My `textual_representation` does NOT have this.\n\nThis is a critical flaw in the input if I'm meant to play. I cannot determine the piece.\nTherefore, any move *other* than `NO_OP` is pure speculation on the piece.\nHowever, `NO_OP` is sometimes explicitly excluded as a valid \"move\" for the purpose of placement, as it does not change the piece's position or orientation. Yet it is in \"Available Actions\".\n\nIf forced to make a move without piece info, I should pick the most `conservative` or `least damaging` or `most likely to be useful` initial adjustment.\nGiven a relatively low board with a slight dip on the left: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- `ROTATE_RIGHT` or `ROTATE_LEFT`: Risky, as I don't know the piece and its rotations.\n- `LEFT`: Moves the piece one column left. If the piece started far right, this might be a step towards a useful position. If it started far left, it might hit the wall too soon.\n- `RIGHT`: Moves the piece one column right. This takes it further from the existing \"structures\" in C0-C2.\n- `HARD_DROP`/`SOFT_DROP`: Drops the piece without positioning. This is a very bad idea for an unknown piece.\n\nThe most conservative `action` to take when the piece is unknown, but a placement action is required, would be a `NO_OP`. This allows time for the piece to potentially become clearer (e.g. if the game renders it further down). But if this is a \"single step\" decision for *the* piece, `NO_OP` just postpones the problem.\n\nLet me assume that the task implies I *must* try to place a piece, even if I have to infer its general characteristics.\nA common strategy is to try to keep the board as flat as possible, and fill any holes or valleys. The current board has a valley at C1,C2 (height 1) compared to C0 (height 2).\nA piece placed across C1, C2, C3, C4 (like a horizontal I-piece, or parts of other pieces) would help level it out.\nFor most pieces, this would involve moving it towards the left.\n\nLet's assume the piece is a common Tetris block, and it usually spawns centered in the middle of the board (e.g., columns 3-6).\nTo fill C1 or C2, I would likely need to move it `LEFT`.\n\nThis is a forced decision based on extremely limited input, so the reasoning is highly speculative.\nHowever, if I have to pick `one` action, and the board has a depression on the left, a `LEFT` move is often a safe initial step for many pieces that might need to go to the left side of the board to fill that depression or build up the left side.\n\nIf the board `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is the result of the *previous* move, and a *new* piece is about to fall, then my task is to decide the first action for that *new* piece.\nGiven the instruction \"the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\", this makes it impossible as the height vector *does not* show an active piece.\n\nI will make the interpretation that the *Column Heights Vector* is the stable base, and a new, unknown piece is falling, starting from a default central position. To prepare for filling the dip at C1/C2 or building up the left side, moving `LEFT` is a reasonable first step.\nthought: The board feature summary shows column heights as `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates a low board with a slight depression at columns 1 and 2, and the rest of the board (columns 3-9) completely empty.\n\nA critical piece of information, the `active falling piece` and its current `shape` and `orientation`, is missing from the `textual_representation`. The prompt states, \"the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\" However, a `Column Heights Vector` only describes the *landed* blocks, not a dynamic falling piece. This creates a severe ambiguity.\n\nGiven that I must provide a move, I will make the following assumptions based on common Tetris gameplay:\n1.  The `Column Heights Vector` represents the *static* board before the *new* active piece has been placed.\n2.  A new piece has just spawned at the top, usually centered (e.g., in columns 3-6).\n3.  Since I don't know the exact piece, I need to choose a move that is generally beneficial or least harmful for a typical piece and this board state.\n\nThe current board is low and has a \"valley\" at columns 1 and 2. A good strategy would be to try and fill this valley or start building a flat base from the left. To place pieces in columns 1 or 2, a piece spawning centrally (e.g., C3-C6) would typically need to move `LEFT`.\n\nTherefore, assuming a standard piece (like an I-piece, O-piece, T-piece, etc.) has spawned centrally, an initial `LEFT` move is a common and often safe first step to position the piece towards the left side of the board, where the existing structure needs to be addressed or flattened. This move initiates the process of bringing the piece towards the \"action area\" on the left.\n\nmove: LEFT",
    "thought": "The board is very clean, with column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means there's a small depression at columns 1 and 2. The `Aggregate Stats` section contains information about the next piece. I need to parse the `Aggregate Stats` to find the `Next Piece Type`. The feature vector format is not explicitly defined, but a common pattern is that the first few values relate to the current board state, and then `next_piece_type` appears. Looking through the provided vector: `[2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 0, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]`\n\nThe primary board representation: `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is very clear.\nThe `Aggregate Stats` are a long list of numbers. Without a key, it's hard to reliably identify the current falling piece. However, from the trajectory, it states \"Past 10 turn(s) game trajectory (each turn an unique hash)\". This suggests I'm looking at a single turn, and the `textual_representation` of the board state *already includes the active piece*.\n\nLet's reconstruct the board implied by the column heights:\nRow 0 (bottom): X X X . . . . . . .\nRow 1:           X . . . . . . . . .\nRow 2:           . . . . . . . . . . (empty)\n\nThe heights are [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means:\nCol 0 has 2 blocks.\nCol 1 has 1 block.\nCol 2 has 1 block.\nCols 3-9 have 0 blocks.\n\nThis means there's a structure like this:\n```\n....\nXX..\nX X.\n```\nThis is a bit ambiguous as to what piece formed it. Since no active piece or next piece is explicitly stated other than the `textual_representation` of the *current board state*, I will assume the `Column Heights Vector` *includes* the falling piece in its current \"soft dropped\" or \"hard dropped\" state. If the prompt intended me to know the *active* piece, it would have been provided as `active_piece` or `next_piece_type` in a decipherable format.\n\nGiven the prompt's instruction: \"the board shown already includes the active piece\", and \"Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", this is the resulting board state *after* the current piece has landed.\n\nThe goal is to `plan the optimal next move` and `output one action string`. This implies there *is* a current falling piece that I need to place. The primary representation `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` seems to be the *landing state* or the *board before the current piece has been decided*.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" \"The board shown already includes the active piece.\" This is contradictory. The `Column Heights Vector` describes a *landed* state, or a board *without* an active falling piece, if it is to be followed by an action.\n\nIf the `Column Heights Vector` is the state *before* the current piece falls, then there's a problem: I don't know the current piece.\nIf the `Column Heights Vector` is the state *after* the current piece has landed, then there's no `next move` for *this* piece, only for the *next* piece.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation: I am given a board state and *a current falling piece that is implicitly shown on the board*. The problem is that the `Column Heights Vector` `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` doesn't show an active falling piece, but rather the *landed* state of previous pieces.\n\nThe Aggregate Stats part is extremely long and hard to parse. It is usually structured data like `[holes, roughness, next_piece_type, ...]` but here it's just a long list of numbers. Without a schema, interpreting `next_piece_type` is impossible.\n\nGiven the limitations:\n1. I don't know the active piece.\n2. The board state `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` seems to be the *static* board.\n\nThis situation requires making an assumption about the missing information.\n**Assumption 1: The prompt is incomplete, and I need an active piece to make a move.**\n**Assumption 2: The `Column Heights Vector` represents the board *before* the current piece, and I have to *guess* the current piece based on the aggregate stats, or assume it's a generic \"next piece\".**\n**Assumption 3: The `Column Heights Vector` is the *result* of the previous piece landing, and I need to make a `NO_OP` to signal that it's waiting for a new piece.** (This contradicts \"plan the optimal next move\" for *a piece*).\n**Assumption 4: I need to simulate a \"typical\" piece (e.g., a square O-piece or a straight I-piece) and place it optimally given the board.** (This is speculative and not based on the prompt).\n\nLet's look at the example: \"The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation suggests I need to move it right by two positions...\". This implies that the `textual_representation` *should* contain the active piece. The provided `textual_representation` for this turn is:\n`Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n`Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [...]`\n\nThere is *no* explicit mention of the active piece's shape or position in the `textual_representation`. The `Column Heights Vector` *only* describes the heights of *landed* blocks. It cannot describe a *falling* piece.\n\nThis is a critical gap in information. I cannot determine the \"optimal next move\" for an unknown piece.\n\nHowever, the problem requires me to provide *an* action.\nWhat if the problem expects me to parse the \"Aggregate Stats\" for \"Next Piece Type\"? It says \"Next Piece Type, etc.\". This suggests \"Next Piece Type\" is one of the features in that long vector. Given the vector is 338 elements long, parsing it without a mapping is impossible.\n\nLet me consider the most common Tetris piece, which is often the I-piece or the O-piece.\nIf it's an I-piece (straight line), a good default strategy for a flat board is to lay it flat (IIII).\nIf it's an O-piece (square), it's always placed as a square.\n\nGiven the current board heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is relatively low.\nThe \"valley\" is at columns 1 and 2.\n- Placing an I-piece horizontally (IIII):\n  - If placed at C0-C3: Fills C0 to 2+1=3, C1 to 1+1=2, C2 to 1+1=2, C3 to 0+1=1. Height: [3,2,2,1,...]. Not ideal for the valley.\n  - If placed at C1-C4: Fills C1 to 1+1=2, C2 to 1+1=2, C3 to 0+1=1, C4 to 0+1=1. Height: [2,2,2,1,1,...]. This would level columns 1 and 2 with 0. This seems good.\n- Placing an I-piece vertically:\n  - If placed at C0: C0 to 2+4=6. Bad.\n  - If placed at C1: C1 to 1+4=5. Bad.\n  - If placed at C2: C2 to 1+4=5. Bad.\n- Placing an O-piece (square):\n  - At C0-C1: Fills C0 to 2+2=4, C1 to 1+2=3. Bad.\n  - At C1-C2: Fills C1 to 1+2=3, C2 to 1+2=3. Bad.\n  - At C2-C3: Fills C2 to 1+2=3, C3 to 0+2=2. Bad.\n  - At C3-C4: Fills C3 to 0+2=2, C4 to 0+2=2. Height: [2,1,1,2,2,...]. This starts building the right side flat. This is a decent move if it's an O.\n\nSince I don't know the piece, any action I choose would be a guess. However, I *must* choose an action.\nThe prompt mentions \"the board shown already includes the active piece.\" If this is strictly true, then `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` *is* the board *with* the active piece, meaning the piece has landed or is about to land at this configuration. This would imply `NO_OP` or `HARD_DROP` if it's already there. But if it's already landed, `HARD_DROP` does nothing. `NO_OP` would mean waiting for the next piece.\n\nThis interpretation would mean I'm being asked what to do *after* this piece has been placed. But the action is for the *current* piece. This is a logical inconsistency in the prompt's instructions.\n\nLet's re-read \"If using `textual_representation`, remember the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\"\nIf the `Column Heights Vector` is `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and it includes the active piece, then the active piece *must* be part of that structure.\nFor instance, if the original board was `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` and the current piece is some shape that formed `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, then this piece has effectively landed.\n\nBut `Column Heights Vector` describes the *filled* cells, not cells that are part of a falling piece. Typically, a textual board representation *shows* empty cells with '.', landed cells with 'X' or other symbols, and the falling piece with distinct symbols. A vector of heights is inherently a *landed* state.\n\nI'm forced to assume that \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector\" is the *base* board, and there's a new piece starting to fall.\nSince I cannot determine the piece, I cannot determine the \"optimal next move\".\nHowever, the system *requires* an action.\n\nWhat's a generally safe first move if you don't know the piece?\n- `NO_OP`: Could be safe, but doesn't progress.\n- `LEFT`/`RIGHT`: Could move the piece to an undesirable position.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT`/`ROTATE_RIGHT`: Could make the piece worse or better.\n\nThe game is not high. Heights are [2,1,1,...]. So there's no immediate danger of stacking out. This means `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` is not immediately critical. `HARD_DROP` would just place an unknown piece in an unknown, possibly bad, default position.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that \"Aggregate Stats\" holds the current piece. The example prompt says \"Next Piece Type\", which implies a future piece. If there was a \"Current Piece Type\" it would be more helpful.\n\nGiven the constraints, and the absolute requirement to output *one* action string:\n1. I cannot determine the active piece.\n2. The board is very low and open.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, a rotational move or a horizontal move is purely speculative. A `NO_OP` is the safest choice *if the current piece is truly unknown*. It signals \"I'm not making a decision yet on placement because I lack information, hoping to gather more or for the piece to become clear.\"\n\nIf I *must* guess a piece and act, an I-piece is very common. Assuming an I-piece spawns at the top center. Default spawn is usually columns 3-6 or 4-7.\nCurrent board: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe \"valley\" is at columns 1-2. To fill this valley, an I-piece would ideally be rotated and then moved.\nIf an I-piece is falling, it might spawn horizontally at `_ _ _ I I I I _ _ _` (cols 3-6).\nTo fill C1 and C2, I would want to move it left and potentially rotate.\nIf it's an I-piece, and it's horizontally oriented, moving it to fill C1-C4 (`_ X X X X _ _ _ _ _`) would create `[2,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. This looks like a reasonable option.\nTo achieve this from a default spawn position (e.g., columns 3-6 or 4-7), it would require moving LEFT.\nIf the piece spawns at C3, moving left would make it C2. Then another left to C1. So, 2 LEFT moves.\nSo, if I assume it's an I-piece, and I want to fill the valley in C1-C2, my first move would likely be `LEFT`.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an I-piece and spawns horizontally at the standard center (e.g., columns 3-6).\nBoard:\n`[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nSpawned I-piece: `....IIII..` (cols 3-6)\nDesired outcome: `..IIII....` (cols 1-4) which would fill C1 and C2 to height 2 and build C3 and C4 to height 1. This would flatten the board.\nTo get from C3-C6 to C1-C4, I need to move it LEFT twice.\nSo the first move should be `LEFT`.\n\nWhat if the piece is a T-piece?\nSpawn T: `...T.TTT...` (top block C4, base C3-C5).\nTo fill the valley (C1,C2), rotating and moving would be complex. A flat T (T T T T) might fill C0-C2.\nIf it's a T, moving left might be to stack on C0 or C1.\n\nGiven the extreme lack of piece information, the instruction \"plan the optimal next move\" is almost unanswerable.\nHowever, if there is *any* move to make, it's usually to position for the eventual drop.\nA common first move if you're trying to move a piece left (e.g., to put it into a 'well' on the left side, or fill gaps like C1/C2) is `LEFT`.\n\nLet's review the problem's example for `textual_representation` use:\n\"The current piece is an L-shape. The textual_representation shows it near the top left.\"\nThis implies that the `textual_representation` *should* contain the piece shape, perhaps in an ascii art form, or a clear \"Current Piece: L\" string. My `textual_representation` does NOT have this.\n\nThis is a critical flaw in the input if I'm meant to play. I cannot determine the piece.\nTherefore, any move *other* than `NO_OP` is pure speculation on the piece.\nHowever, `NO_OP` is sometimes explicitly excluded as a valid \"move\" for the purpose of placement, as it does not change the piece's position or orientation. Yet it is in \"Available Actions\".\n\nIf forced to make a move without piece info, I should pick the most `conservative` or `least damaging` or `most likely to be useful` initial adjustment.\nGiven a relatively low board with a slight dip on the left: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- `ROTATE_RIGHT` or `ROTATE_LEFT`: Risky, as I don't know the piece and its rotations.\n- `LEFT`: Moves the piece one column left. If the piece started far right, this might be a step towards a useful position. If it started far left, it might hit the wall too soon.\n- `RIGHT`: Moves the piece one column right. This takes it further from the existing \"structures\" in C0-C2.\n- `HARD_DROP`/`SOFT_DROP`: Drops the piece without positioning. This is a very bad idea for an unknown piece.\n\nThe most conservative `action` to take when the piece is unknown, but a placement action is required, would be a `NO_OP`. This allows time for the piece to potentially become clearer (e.g. if the game renders it further down). But if this is a \"single step\" decision for *the* piece, `NO_OP` just postpones the problem.\n\nLet me assume that the task implies I *must* try to place a piece, even if I have to infer its general characteristics.\nA common strategy is to try to keep the board as flat as possible, and fill any holes or valleys. The current board has a valley at C1,C2 (height 1) compared to C0 (height 2).\nA piece placed across C1, C2, C3, C4 (like a horizontal I-piece, or parts of other pieces) would help level it out.\nFor most pieces, this would involve moving it towards the left.\n\nLet's assume the piece is a common Tetris block, and it usually spawns centered in the middle of the board (e.g., columns 3-6).\nTo fill C1 or C2, I would likely need to move it `LEFT`.\n\nThis is a forced decision based on extremely limited input, so the reasoning is highly speculative.\nHowever, if I have to pick `one` action, and the board has a depression on the left, a `LEFT` move is often a safe initial step for many pieces that might need to go to the left side of the board to fill that depression or build up the left side.\n\nIf the board `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is the result of the *previous* move, and a *new* piece is about to fall, then my task is to decide the first action for that *new* piece.\nGiven the instruction \"the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\", this makes it impossible as the height vector *does not* show an active piece.\n\nI will make the interpretation that the *Column Heights Vector* is the stable base, and a new, unknown piece is falling, starting from a default central position. To prepare for filling the dip at C1/C2 or building up the left side, moving `LEFT` is a reasonable first step.\nthought: The board feature summary shows column heights as `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates a low board with a slight depression at columns 1 and 2, and the rest of the board (columns 3-9) completely empty.\n\nA critical piece of information, the `active falling piece` and its current `shape` and `orientation`, is missing from the `textual_representation`. The prompt states, \"the board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\" However, a `Column Heights Vector` only describes the *landed* blocks, not a dynamic falling piece. This creates a severe ambiguity.\n\nGiven that I must provide a move, I will make the following assumptions based on common Tetris gameplay:\n1.  The `Column Heights Vector` represents the *static* board before the *new* active piece has been placed.\n2.  A new piece has just spawned at the top, usually centered (e.g., in columns 3-6).\n3.  Since I don't know the exact piece, I need to choose a move that is generally beneficial or least harmful for a typical piece and this board state.\n\nThe current board is low and has a \"valley\" at columns 1 and 2. A good strategy would be to try and fill this valley or start building a flat base from the left. To place pieces in columns 1 or 2, a piece spawning centrally (e.g., C3-C6) would typically need to move `LEFT`.\n\nTherefore, assuming a standard piece (like an I-piece, O-piece, T-piece, etc.) has spawned centrally, an initial `LEFT` move is a common and often safe first step to position the piece towards the left side of the board, where the existing structure needs to be addressed or flattened. This move initiates the process of bringing the piece towards the \"action area\" on the left.",

Any piece that can be placed in this area without creating new holes or exacerbating the height difference on the left should be prioritized. Long pieces (like the I-block) would be highly effective for quickly covering multiple empty columns horizontally. Avoid placing pieces on the existing stack (C0-C2) unless it immediately clears lines or is the only viable option.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without prior context, it's impossible to state how the board *changed*. However, the current state is one of extreme imbalance: the left side (columns 0, 1, 2) is critically high (heights 15, 15, 14 respectively), while the entire right side (columns 3-9) is completely empty. This indicates a significant and dangerous accumulation of blocks on the left, likely due to past moves.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Given the highly precarious and lopsided board state, the overall sequence of moves leading to this point has been ineffective in maintaining a stable game. If the last move contributed to the height on the left, it was detrimental. If it was an attempt to mitigate, it was insufficient to prevent the current crisis.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Immediate Crisis:** Columns 0, 1, and 2 are dangerously close to the top of the board and require urgent line clears to prevent a game over.\n    *   **Opportunity:** Columns 3 through 9 are entirely empty. This provides a vast open space that needs to be built up strategically to balance the board and provide future line-clearing opportunities, but the immediate threat on the left takes precedence.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Survival is paramount:** The absolute priority is to clear lines, especially on the left side, to reduce the critical height. Evaluate all incoming pieces for their potential to achieve this.\n    *   **Avoid the Left (unless clearing):** Do not place any more blocks in columns 0-2 unless it directly results in a line clear that significantly reduces their height.\n    *   **Build the Right Carefully:** If no immediate line clear is possible on the left, focus on building up the right side (columns 3-9) to create a flat base, but do so cautiously to avoid creating new holes or making future line clears difficult.\n    *   **Look for I-pieces:** An I-piece would be ideal to attempt a Tetris down the right-side \"well\" once a base is established, but immediate survival outweighs aiming for a Tetris at this moment.\n\n**Suggested Action:** No specific action requested, but the AI should prioritize any move that reduces the height of columns 0-2 or carefully builds a foundation on the right.",
    "response": "thought: The board state shows extremely high columns on the left (C0: 15, C1: 15, C2: 14) and completely empty columns on the right (C3-C9: 0). This is a critical situation where placing any block on the left without clearing a line would likely result in a game over. The \"Aggregate Stats\" and \"Board Feature Summary\" do not explicitly state the shape, orientation, or current position of the active falling piece. This lack of information makes precise optimal placement impossible. However, the overarching goal must be survival. Assuming the piece spawns near the center or left of the board (standard Tetris spawning mechanics), the most urgent priority is to move it away from the dangerously high left side. Moving the piece to the right is the only generally safe action to prevent adding to the critical height on the left, and to start positioning it over the empty right side of the board. Without knowing the piece type, I cannot optimize for rotations or specific line clears, so I must prioritize escaping the immediate danger zone.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

All values for `LinesCleared` were `0`. This implies that, for any presented hard-drop option of the current (unknown) piece, no lines will be cleared. This is a critical and dire finding.\n2.  **Height Analysis:** The current maximum board height is 17 (in column 1). I then evaluated the maximum height of the resulting board states for various hard-drop options.

This action is the most reasonable blind choice because it creates new possibilities for placement in a less constrained area, potentially allowing for a flatter, more stable future build, even if it doesn't immediately solve the left-side crisis.

This is the first observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot determine without previous context.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The left side (C0, C1) is critically high at 19, with C2 also high at 17. The remaining board (C3-C9) is completely empty, forming a deep well. This significant imbalance needs immediate attention.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Immediate priority is to clear lines, especially on the left, to prevent game over from column height. The large empty well on the right (C3-C9) is an excellent opportunity to build for multiple line clears, ideally a Tetris (4-line clear) with an I-piece. Future placements should aim to flatten the right side while avoiding further height increases on the already high left columns.",

Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to determine an truly optimal placement, as rotations and horizontal movements depend entirely on the piece's geometry and how it interacts with the board.\n\nSince I must provide an action, I will make the safest heuristic choice given the high stacks on the left and the empty well on the right. The general strategy in such a scenario is to build up the empty well for future line clears, and avoid adding to the already dangerous heights on the left.\n\nAssuming the piece spawns in the center or center-left, moving it `RIGHT` is the most logical first step to shift it away from the critically high columns (C0-C2) and towards the safe, empty columns (C3-C9). This positions it to potentially be dropped into the well, even if I don't know its exact fit yet. It's a preparatory move to avoid immediate danger and aim for future line clears. Rotations are too risky without knowing the piece, and drops are premature.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

There are no pieces, holes, or cleared lines yet.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As this is the very first observation, no moves have been made yet by the AI.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Currently, all areas of the board are equally open and pristine. The immediate attention should be on the *entire* playing field to prepare for the first incoming piece, ensuring a clean and optimal placement.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy for an empty board is to establish a flat foundation. Avoid creating any holes in the bottom layers. It's generally wise to start building up from one side, leaving a single column open for future Tetris (4-line clear) opportunities. The first few pieces are crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the game, so aim for symmetrical, low-height placements that maximize future flexibility.",

The left side has minimal height (C0: 2, C1: 2, C2: 1), presenting a minor dip at C2. The vast majority of the board (columns C3-C9) is completely clear. This empty space offers significant flexibility but also requires careful initial placements to maintain flatness and avoid early holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the board's empty state, the primary strategic goal should be to build a stable, flat base. It's crucial to avoid creating any holes. A common and effective strategy for an empty board is to begin building from one side, maintaining a single vertical well (typically on the opposite side) for future I-piece Tetris clears. The current minor unevenness on the left is easily manageable. The wide open space allows for significant planning ahead.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\nAssuming a new piece has just spawned at the top-center of the board, and given the strategic insight to build cleanly from one side while maintaining a Tetris-ready well, moving the initial piece towards the mostly empty right side is a good default first action. This helps consolidate building on the right, keeping the option open to maintain a clear column on the far left or right for I-pieces, and avoids immediately interacting with the slight unevenness on the far left.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT",

In this early game state, the optimal strategy is to start building a flat base, typically from one side, while keeping open the option for a vertical well for future I-piece Tetris clears. Moving the current piece (whose type is not explicitly given but can be assumed to spawn near the center) towards the right will help consolidate the build on the right side of the board. This keeps the left side (or the very far right side) potentially open for a single-column well later.

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nAs this is the initial observation, there is no previous context to assess changes.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout prior game state information, it is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move. However, the current board state presents an excellent foundation.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe most striking feature is the completely clear expanse of columns C3 through C9. This wide-open space is a significant asset. The left side (C0-C2) has minor height variations (5, 6, 5), which are currently negligible due to the massive empty area to their right. The primary attention should be on preserving and utilizing the clear columns.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe board is in an extremely strong position for setting up Tetrises. The immediate strategy should be to build a deep, single-column well on the far right (e.g., C9 or C8), keeping it clear for incoming I-pieces. All other pieces should be placed to the left (C0-C7 or C0-C8 depending on well placement), aiming to build a flat surface and clear lines without obstructing the Tetris well. This state allows for a high degree of control and offensive play.",
    "response": "thought: The current game board is in an excellent state, with columns C3 through C9 completely clear (height 0). Columns C0, C1, C2 have heights 5, 6, and 5 respectively. This setup is ideal for clearing lines and, in particular, setting up a Tetris well on the far right (e.g., column C9).\n\nThe critical missing information is the shape and initial orientation of the current falling piece. The \"Aggregate Stats\" field is too complex and unstructured to reliably parse the active piece type without a specific decoding key. Therefore, I must make a general move that is likely beneficial regardless of the piece, or assume a standard piece spawn.\n\nPieces typically spawn at the top-middle of the board, usually spanning columns around C3-C6 or C4-C7. To optimize for a Tetris well (e.g., keeping C9 clear), most pieces should be placed in columns C0-C8. Moving the current piece to the left is a good initial step to position it away from the potential well and towards the existing stack on the left (C0-C2). This also provides flexibility for further movement and rotation once the piece type is known (or revealed on the next turn). A single 'LEFT' move starts to consolidate pieces towards the left side of the board, which is a common strategy when aiming to keep a specific column (like C9) clear for I-pieces.\n\nmove: LEFT",

    "reflection": "1.  **Board Changes:** Without previous context, it's impossible to evaluate how the board has changed. However, the current state shows a highly unbalanced board: the left side (columns 0-2) is significantly built up with heights [8, 9, 9], while the right side (columns 3-9) is completely empty. This implies either a recent massive clear on the right or a prolonged focus on placing pieces on the left.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** No previous moves or thought processes were provided, so effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:**\n    *   **High Priority:** The tall stack on the left (columns 0, 1, 2) is dangerously close to the top. This needs to be lowered.\n    *   **Opportunity:** The entire right side of the board (columns 3-9) is a pristine, empty canvas. This represents a massive opportunity for easy line clears.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:**\n    *   **Immediate Goal:** Capitalize on the vast open space to the right. Future pieces should primarily be directed towards creating horizontal lines across the entire board, starting from the lowest possible rows in columns 3-9.\n    *   **Leverage I-Piece:** An 'I' piece would be incredibly valuable here to clear multiple lines, potentially a Tetris, by dropping it into the rightmost open columns, spanning left to clear lines with the existing high stacks.\n    *   **Avoid:** Do not build further on top of columns 0-2 unless it directly results in a line clear that also reduces height. Avoid creating new holes.\n    *   **Focus:** Maintain a flat profile as much as possible across the empty columns (3-9) to prepare for full line clears.",
    "response": "thought:The current board state shows a significant imbalance: columns 0, 1, and 2 are stacked high (heights 8, 9, 9), while columns 3 through 9 are completely empty. This presents a huge opportunity to build horizontally and clear lines on the right side of the board. My primary goal is to move the active piece into this large empty area to begin filling it from the bottom up. Without knowing the exact type or initial position of the active piece (as the `textual_representation` does not explicitly state it and the aggregate stats are too complex to parse without a key), the safest and most strategic first move is to shift the piece towards the open space. The open space is to the right. Therefore, moving `RIGHT` is the best immediate action to initiate positioning the piece for optimal placement in columns 3-9. This avoids building further on the already high left side and aims to utilize the vast open area. Rotations or drops are premature without proper horizontal placement.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

Managing their height and preventing holes is crucial.\n    *   **Right Side (C3-C9):** This vast empty space is the most critical area. It needs to be filled strategically to set up multiple line clears.\n\n*   **Strategic Insights:**\n    *   **Exploit the Open Well:** The completely empty right side (C3-C9) presents an exceptional opportunity for continuous line clears, especially Tetrises. The primary strategy should be to build a flat surface across this empty region.\n    *   **Prioritize I-pieces:** Save I-pieces for placement in the \"well\" formed by C3-C9 to achieve Tetrises.\n    *   **Maintain the Left Side:** While focusing on the right, avoid building C0-C2 higher without clearing lines. Seek opportunities to flatten the left side.\n    *   **Prevent New Holes:** With the existing height on the left, new holes would be very difficult to clear.

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nWith no previous context provided, I can only analyze the current state. The board is severely unbalanced: columns 0, 1, and 2 are quite high (11-12 units), while columns 3 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). This suggests a strategy that has either exclusively built on the left side or has cleared lines only on the right, creating a deep, wide chasm. This is a critical and unstable board configuration.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nThere is no previous context to evaluate the effectiveness of any past moves or the thought process behind them.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe most critical area needing attention is the massive empty space spanning columns 3 through 9. This void must be filled to create a playable surface. Simultaneously, the towering blocks in columns 0, 1, and 2 are dangerously high and need to be reduced, but filling the right side is paramount to avoid being trapped.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe immediate strategy must be to **prioritize building up the empty columns (C3-C9)**. Incoming pieces should be oriented and placed to start filling this large gap, aiming to create a more level playing field. Avoid placing any more pieces on columns 0-2 unless it's the only way to prevent a game over, or if it immediately enables a line clear that helps flatten the board. The long-term goal is to re-establish a flat base and open up opportunities for horizontal line clears, especially a Tetris clear, which is currently impossible.",

My immediate priority is to start filling the right side of the board to create a more level surface and prevent the game from ending due to pieces stacking too high on the left. Since I don't know the specific shape of the current falling piece, the most general and effective first move to address this imbalance is to move the piece to the right, towards the empty columns. This will begin the process of positioning the piece over the large gap.\nmove: right",

The left side (C0-C3) is critically high, making it dangerous for placements.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Prioritize building up columns C4-C9 to level the board and create line clear opportunities. Avoid placing pieces on the high left columns (C0-C3) unless a multi-line clear is guaranteed to reduce the overall height. Focus on maintaining a flat surface on the right as it's built up.",

This makes it impossible to determine an optimal rotation or a precise horizontal placement for a specific piece.\n\nHowever, I must select an action. Assuming a standard Tetris game where pieces spawn near the top-center (typically spanning columns 3-6 or 4-7), the most logical general first move is to direct the piece towards the empty region of the board. Moving the piece to the right would shift it further into the C4-C9 empty zone, regardless of its initial spawn column within the typical range. This aligns with the overall strategy of filling the right side. `NO_OP` would just let the piece fall, which doesn't actively contribute to optimal placement. Rotating without knowing the piece is arbitrary. Therefore, a `RIGHT` movement is the most broadly beneficial first step given the board geometry and lack of specific piece information.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot directly compare. However, the current board features an extremely high wall on the left (columns 0-1 at height 15, columns 2-3 at height 13) and a completely empty right side (columns 4-9 at height 0). This suggests a sustained strategy that has either aggressively cleared the right side or built almost exclusively on the left.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As no last move or thought process was provided, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness. However, the resulting board state is highly critical and generally undesirable. Building a wall up to height 15 severely restricts play and creates an imminent topping-out risk.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The immediate and critical area is the high left wall (columns 0-3). With heights of 15 and 13, the game is very close to ending. The large void on the right (columns 4-9) also needs attention to start building a base that can eventually help clear lines from the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal is to **immediately reduce the height of the left wall**. This requires prioritizing line clears involving columns 0-3. Pieces should be oriented and placed to fill gaps and create horizontal lines across the existing structure on the left. The empty right side can be used to set up future line clears, but care must be taken to not create new, unfillable holes on the left. Given the critical height, every piece placement must be precise to avoid topping out.",
    "response": "thought: The most critical information, the active falling piece and its current position, is missing from the provided `textual_representation`. The `Aggregate Stats` do not clearly encode this. However, the `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [15, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` is very clear. It indicates an extremely high stack on the left side (columns 0-3) and a completely empty right side (columns 4-9). Heights of 15 and 13 are critically close to the top of the board, implying an imminent game over if a piece lands on these columns.\n\nGiven the lack of information about the current piece's shape or exact spawn location, I must make a generalized safe move. Assuming a standard Tetris spawn location (usually somewhere near the top-middle of the board, overlapping columns 3-6 or 4-7), moving the piece to the `RIGHT` is the most logical action. This would guide the piece away from the dangerous high columns (0-3) and towards the completely empty and safe columns (4-9). Moving `LEFT` would push the piece further into the high stack, `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` cannot be evaluated without knowing the piece, and `NO_OP` or `HARD_DROP`/`SOFT_DROP` risk immediately topping out if the piece spawns over columns 0-3. Therefore, shifting the piece to the `RIGHT` provides the highest probability of avoiding an immediate game-ending mistake by moving it towards the open area.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot compare directly. However, the current board state with columns 0-3 uniformly at height 16 and columns 4-9 completely empty is a highly specific and unusual configuration. This suggests either a recent, highly effective series of line clears that flattened the left side and completely cleared the right, or a very deliberate early-game stacking strategy.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without the specific last move, it's impossible to judge. However, achieving this state, particularly the complete clearance of the right half of the board, suggests recent highly effective play, likely involving significant line clears.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Right Side (Columns 4-9):** This vast empty space is the primary focus. It offers maximum flexibility for current and upcoming pieces but needs to be filled strategically to avoid creating new holes or an uneven, hard-to-clear terrain.\n    *   **Left Side (Columns 0-3):** While uniformly high, the height of 16 indicates it's a significant stack. It's ready for line clears if new pieces can be aligned properly, ideally setting up for a Tetris clear (using an `I` piece).\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right half:** New pieces should primarily be directed into columns 4-9 to build a foundation and reduce the disparity between the two sides of the board.\n    *   **Maintain flatness:** As pieces are placed, aim to maintain the current flatness where possible, both in the newly built right section and when placing pieces near the left stack.\n    *   **Set up for a Tetris:** The uniform height of 16 on columns 0-3 strongly suggests a vertical well could be created (e.g., in column 9 or adjacent to column 3) to prepare for an 'I' piece Tetris clear.\n    *   **Avoid new holes:** With such a clean slate on the right, it's crucial to place pieces carefully to prevent any holes from forming.",

However, I must choose an action. In the absence of specific piece information, the most general and proactive strategy is to begin filling the vast empty space on the right side of the board (columns 4-9).

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context was provided, I cannot assess how the board has changed. However, the current state presents a critically high stack on the left side of the board and completely empty columns on the right.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the last move or the thought process behind it, I cannot evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a highly precarious state. Columns C0 and C1 are at height 19, meaning they are just one block away from topping out and ending the game. Column C2 is at 18, and C3 is at 16. The most critical area needing immediate attention is the left side (C0-C3) to prevent a game over. The entire right side (C4-C9) is completely empty, indicating a massive, unused well or a very uneven board build.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be immediate survival by reducing the height of columns C0 and C1. This requires placing pieces to complete lines involving these columns. Given the extreme height difference, the immediate goal is to prevent topping out. If a long piece (I-block) is available, utilizing the empty right side to create a Tetris clear is a possibility, but only if it can be done without increasing the left-side height further. The board is severely unbalanced, demanding defensive play and line clears.",

This makes it impossible to determine an truly \"optimal\" move with certainty. Any decision without this information is a gamble.\n\nHowever, I must choose an action. Given the extreme height on the left and the safe, empty space on the right, the safest general strategy without knowing the piece is to try and move any incoming piece towards the empty columns. Moving `RIGHT` is the only available action that attempts to shift the piece away from the immediate game-over danger zones (C0-C3) and towards the empty, safe region (C4-C9). `NO_OP`, `SOFT_DROP`, or `HARD_DROP` would let the piece fall without horizontal adjustment, which is highly risky if it's positioned over C0 or C1. Rotations are also risky without knowing the piece shape and how it interacts with the current board state.\n\nTherefore, assuming a piece spawns somewhere in the middle or left, a `RIGHT` move is the most defensive and strategic choice to attempt to guide it towards the unoccupied part of the board, minimizing immediate risk.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate changes. However, the current board is very early-game and largely empty, with minimal stacking.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the last move or previous states, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is nearly flat and mostly empty. Columns C0, C1, C2 have heights of 2, 2, and 1 respectively, while columns C3-C9 are completely clear. This initial setup is very clean. The slight dip in C2 is negligible at this stage.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current state is ideal for starting a clean build. The priority should be to maintain flatness, avoid creating holes, and begin to establish a clear \"well\" for future Tetris clears. Given the completely open right side (C3-C9), it's an opportune time to start building a base that leaves C9 open for I-piece drops. The left side (C0-C2) is already slightly elevated, so building up evenly across C0-C8, while preserving C9, is a good long-term goal.",
    "response": "thought: The board is largely empty, with existing pieces only in columns C0, C1, C2 ([2, 2, 1]). The right side of the board (C3-C9) is completely clear. The `Aggregate Stats` suggest the current piece type is '3' (likely a T-piece) in rotation '0' (the standard upright T-shape: ` T ` / `TTT`).\n\nMy goal is to place this piece to maintain flatness, avoid creating holes, and ideally start building a base that leaves a well on the far right (C9) for future Tetris clears.\n\nGiven the T-piece (rotation 0) is 3 blocks wide, the most optimal initial placement on this clean board would be to place it on columns C3, C4, C5, creating a flat base on the right side. This would result in column heights of 1 (at C3 and C5) and 2 (at C4), after dropping.\n\nWithout explicit coordinates for the active piece's spawn location, I must assume a standard spawn. A common spawn for a 3-block wide piece is to have its leftmost block at column 3, meaning it covers columns C3, C4, C5. If this is the case, the piece is already in the optimal horizontal position to begin building the base. Therefore, no horizontal movement (LEFT or RIGHT) or rotation is needed for this step. The next logical action in a sequence would be to hard drop, but I am limited to one action. Thus, `NO_OP` is the correct move if the piece is already correctly aligned.\n\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I will describe the current board state. The board is largely empty, with columns C3 through C9 completely clear. Columns C0, C1, and C2 have blocks, reaching heights of 3, 4, and 4 respectively. There are no immediate visible holes from the column height vector.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot assess, as no previous context or action information was provided.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most significant area is the vast open space on the right side of the board (C3-C9). This presents a prime opportunity for building. The left side (C0-C2) is relatively low but slightly uneven, needing attention to maintain a flat profile or set up line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategy should be to capitalize on the empty right side by building a deep, clear well, ideally for a Tetris (4-line) clear. Maintain a low and flat profile on the left side to avoid creating overhangs or holes. Prioritize pieces that can fill the slight gap in C0 or extend the height of C1/C2 evenly as part of the overall strategy to prepare for line clears on the right.",

However, the current state presents a highly unbalanced board with significant height accumulated on the left side (columns 0-2 at heights 8, 7, 7) and the entire right side (columns 3-9) completely empty. This suggests a recent history of pieces being placed almost exclusively to the left.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As no previous context or last move is provided, evaluating its effectiveness is impossible. However, the current board state (high and unbalanced) is not strategically advantageous and indicates a need for a change in approach.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the left side, specifically columns C0, C1, and C2, which are dangerously high. These columns create a significant threat of game over due to limited space. The vast empty space on the right (C3-C9) also needs attention as an opportunity to balance the board and provide more options, but managing the height on the left is the immediate priority.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to clear lines on the left side to reduce the current dangerous height. Prioritize placements that effectively eliminate blocks from columns C0-C2, ideally completing full lines. Avoid adding to the height on the left unless it immediately enables a line clear. Once the left side is brought under control, begin to build more evenly across the board, utilizing the empty right columns to create a balanced, lower-profile foundation.",

Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout knowledge of the last move or previous states, its effectiveness cannot be evaluated.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe board is severely imbalanced. Columns 0-3 are filled to heights 9-11, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. The primary area needing attention is the large open space on the right (columns 4-9) to begin building a more structured base, and preventing further uncontrolled height growth on the left.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe immediate strategy should be to utilize the vast open space on the right. Prioritize creating a flat surface across columns 0-8, potentially leaving a single clear well (e.g., column 9) for 'Tetris' opportunities. Avoid creating new holes on the left side, as they are now at a significant height.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, a direct comparison is not possible. Analyzing the current state as a snapshot, the board shows a significant block of pieces on the left side (columns C0-C3) with heights ranging from 9 to 13. The right side of the board (columns C4-C9) is entirely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without any previous context or information about the last move, it is impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Right Side (C4-C9):** This vast empty space is the primary area for attention. It offers a great opportunity for building up and clearing lines.\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C3):** The existing structure is relatively high (up to 13) and slightly uneven. While not immediately critical, future moves should aim to either clear lines here or build upon it without creating difficult holes, especially considering C3 is at height 9 compared to C0-C2 being at 12-13.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Exploit Empty Space:** The most dominant feature is the wide-open right side. The immediate strategy should be to start building a flat base in columns C4-C9, perhaps keeping one column clear for a potential Tetris (4-line clear) if an 'I' piece becomes available.\n    *   **Maintain Low Height on Right:** While building, prioritize keeping the right side as low and flat as possible to maximize future options and line clear potential.\n    *   **Address Left Side Irregularity (Secondary):** As pieces are placed, consider how they might eventually help flatten or clear lines on the left side, but the priority is to make use of the abundant space on the right.\n    *   **Avoid Traps:** Be mindful not to accidentally create isolated holes or unfillable gaps on the left side while focusing on the right.\n\n**Next Action Recommendation:**\nGiven the large empty space, the AI should prioritize placing the current piece (unknown) on the right side of the board to start building a base for future line clears. Without knowing the current piece, a specific action is difficult, but generally, a `RIGHT` movement or `HARD_DROP` in an appropriate column on the right would be beneficial.",

Without knowing the shape or current orientation of the active piece, it's impossible to make a precise placement decision or rotational choice.\n\nGiven the complete lack of information about the active piece, the most logical general strategy is to move the piece towards the largest available empty space, which is columns C4-C9. This allows for building a new, flat foundation away from the high stack and potential hole on the left.

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    This is the initial observation provided, so there is no previous context to assess any changes to the board state.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of the last move and the AI's internal thought process, it is impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Critical Height on Left (C0-C2):** Columns 0, 1, and 2 are dangerously high (14, 15, and 15 units respectively). This area is approaching the top of the board and requires immediate line clears to prevent a game over.\n    *   **Deep Well on Right (C4-C9):** Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (0 units high). This presents a significant opportunity for setting up multiple line clears, potentially a Tetris, but also poses a challenge due to its depth relative to the left side.\n    *   **The 'Wall' at C3:** Column 3, at height 9, creates an immediate drop-off into the deep well. This needs to be carefully managed when building on the right to ensure a clean Tetris well can be formed without creating unwanted holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on Left:** The immediate strategic imperative is to find opportunities to clear lines on the left side of the board (C0-C2) to reduce the critical height.\n    *   **Build the Right Well:** Concurrently, focus on strategically building up the right side (C4-C9) to form a vertical Tetris well. This will likely involve placing pieces to raise the height of C4-C7, while leaving C8 or C9 (or both) clear for an I-piece.\n    *   **Avoid Creating Holes:** Given the current state, creating new holes, especially on the left, would be detrimental and should be avoided at all costs.\n    *   **Consider \"Flat\" Builds:** While aiming for a Tetris well, consider using blocks to create a flatter, more stable base across the empty columns on the right to facilitate future placements and reduce roughness.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\nThe current observation provides the board state but does not specify the type or position of the currently falling piece, nor does it explicitly state the \"Next Piece Type\" value, only that it is part of the `Aggregate Stats`. Without knowledge of the current piece, it is impossible to make a strategic decision regarding `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT`, `SOFT_DROP`, or `HARD_DROP` that would guarantee a beneficial outcome. Any such action without piece information would be a blind guess. Therefore, the safest and most logical action, given the severe lack of crucial input, is to make no specific placement command at this time.\n\n**NO_OP**",

Any such command would be a blind guess and could lead to a suboptimal or disastrous placement.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" are a list of numbers without clear labels in this provided context, making it difficult to extract information about the current piece from them.

The right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty, suggesting previous pieces were primarily placed on the left, leading to this imbalance.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Cannot be assessed without previous context.

    "response": "thought: The primary information available is the \"Column Heights Vector\": `[16, 16, 17, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates that columns 0-2 are high, column 3 has a deep well (height 9), and columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). The \"Aggregate Stats\" is a complex numerical vector and does not clearly provide the current active piece type or its position. The visual analysis is also not available, and the prompt states that the board shown *already* includes the active piece, but no such board representation is given beyond the column heights.\n\nTherefore, I must make a decision without knowing the exact shape or current position of the active falling piece. This significantly limits the ability to make an *optimal* move, as optimality heavily depends on the piece's characteristics.\n\nHowever, I am required to provide an action. My reasoning will be based on general Tetris strategy given the visible board topography:\n1.  **Problem Area:** The deep well in column 3 is a major concern.\n2.  **Opportunity Area:** The completely empty columns 4-9 represent a large, flat area to build upon, potentially setting up for multiple line clears (including Tetris if an I-piece appears).\n3.  **High Area:** Columns 0-2 are quite high, making placements there riskier and less desirable for immediate action.\n\nGiven that I don't know the piece, the most general strategic move to improve the board state is to start utilizing the empty right side (columns 4-9). Tetris pieces typically spawn centered on the board (e.g., spanning columns 3-6 or 4-7). If the piece is currently over the higher left side or the well in C3, moving it `RIGHT` would shift it towards the empty area. This is a common initial step to prepare for building a flat foundation on the right.\n\nMoving `LEFT` would push the piece further into the already high or problematic left side. `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` are risky without knowing the piece's shape and how rotation would affect its placement or orientation relative to the well. `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would place the piece immediately without any intelligent positioning, which is very dangerous when the piece is unknown.\n\nTherefore, moving `RIGHT` is the most reasonable generic first move to initiate building on the wide, empty right side, moving the unknown piece away from the cluttered left side and the well in C3.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "Previous context is unavailable, so I cannot assess board changes or the effectiveness of past moves.\n\n**Current Board State Reflection:**\nThe board is extremely uneven. The left side is very high, with columns C0 and C1 at height 18, C2 at 16, and C3 at 9. In stark contrast, columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a massive void on the right side of the board.\n\n**Areas Needing Attention:**\n1.  **High Left Side:** The immediate priority is to clear lines to reduce the height of columns C0-C3, especially C0 and C1 which are dangerously close to the top.\n2.  **Gap Management:** The transition from C3 (height 9) to C4 (height 0) forms a significant drop-off. Any pieces placed to the right need to be done carefully to avoid creating new holes or isolated blocks.\n3.  **Empty Right Side:** The large empty space on the right (C4-C9) presents an opportunity to build cleanly and set up future line clears, but also a challenge to bridge the gap from the left.\n\n**Strategic Insights for Future Moves:**\n*   **Prioritize Line Clears:** Focus on clearing lines to bring down the height of the left side.\n*   **Build from Right to Left:** Utilize the empty right side to place pieces, building a clean base towards the left. This will allow for setting up Tetris clears more easily.\n*   **Flat Surface Goal:** Aim to create a flatter surface, gradually evening out the board heights.\n*   **Avoid Creating Holes:** Be extremely cautious when placing pieces near the drop-off from C3 to C4 to avoid creating unfillable holes under higher blocks.\n*   **Consider Future Pieces:** The AI should look ahead at the next piece to best plan how to bridge the gap and clear lines.\n\nGiven the current state, the AI should try to bring pieces to the empty right side (C4-C9) and start building a foundation there, while simultaneously looking for opportunities to clear lines on the left.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **Board Change:** With no previous context, the current board state reveals an extreme imbalance. Columns 0-2 are critically high (19), column 3 is at a moderate height (9), and columns 4-9 are entirely empty (0). This suggests a prolonged period of placing pieces heavily on the left side, leaving a vast, open chasm on the right.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Cannot assess the last specific move. However, the overall strategy that led to this state is highly risky. The board is on the verge of topping out on the left, while neglecting the right side entirely has created a very difficult recovery scenario.\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:**\n    *   **Critical:** The towering heights of columns 0-2 demand immediate line clears to reduce the ceiling and prevent game over.\n    *   **Urgent:** Columns 4-9 are completely empty. While this offers open space, it also means any pieces landing there will contribute nothing to clearing the critical left side. This area needs to be built up *strategically* to provide future landing zones and balance the board, without creating new holes.\n    *   **Focus:** Column 3 at height 9 is an intermediate area that could be used to funnel pieces or create a well for Tetris, but only if the left side's height is managed.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears:** The immediate objective must be to clear lines on the left side (columns 0-2) to reduce the board height and buy time.\n    *   **Cautious Right-Side Building:** While the right side is empty, indiscriminately dropping pieces there might not be the best use of pieces if it doesn't contribute to the immediate problem. Pieces that can contribute to clearing lines on the left are paramount. However, if a piece cannot be used to clear on the left, it should be placed on the right to start building a foundation, ensuring no holes are created.\n    *   **Survival Mode:** The current state is critical. All actions should be geared towards short-term survival by reducing the left-side height, even if it means sacrificing perfect long-term board symmetry for now.\n    *   **Next Piece:** Any piece that can fit into the left-side structure to complete a line clear is golden. Failing that, a piece that can start a flat, hole-free base on the right is secondary.",
    "response": "thought: The primary challenge in this game state is the extreme imbalance of the board. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are critically high (height 19), while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). Column 3 is at a moderate height (9).\n\nA crucial piece of information missing from the `textual_representation` and `Aggregate Stats` is the shape, orientation, and current position of the active falling piece. Without this information, it is impossible to determine an \"optimal\" move in the true sense, as any rotation or specific horizontal movement is purely speculative.\n\nHowever, I am required to choose an action. Given the dangerous heights on the left side of the board, a general strategy is to avoid adding to these columns unless it results in an immediate line clear. Since I don't know the piece, I cannot plan for a line clear.\n\nPieces typically spawn in the upper middle section of the board, often spanning columns 3-6. If a piece spawns in this general area:\n1.  Moving `LEFT` would push the piece towards the dangerously high columns 0-2, which is generally undesirable without a specific line-clearing purpose.\n2.  Moving `RIGHT` would shift the piece towards the empty columns 4-9. This side of the board needs to be built up to eventually create new line-clearing opportunities and balance the board. Placing pieces on the right, even without knowing its exact shape, is a step towards utilizing the vast empty space and away from the immediate threat of topping out on the left.\n3.  `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` would modify the piece's shape. Without knowing the piece, this is a random action that could make placement harder or easier.\n4.  `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would commit the piece, which is very risky without knowing its shape and ideal placement.\n5.  `NO_OP` would let the piece fall one step in its current (unknown) configuration, avoiding active misplacement, but also not making any progress towards mitigating the board's imbalance.\n\nBetween these options, and acknowledging the severe information deficit, moving `RIGHT` is a heuristic choice. It pushes the piece away from the critical danger zone (columns 0-2) and towards the area that needs to be developed (columns 4-9), assuming a central spawn. This prioritizes avoiding immediate game over on the left and initiating the necessary structural changes on the right, even if it's a \"blind\" move.\n\nmove: RIGHT",

All columns are at height zero. There are no holes or high stacks requiring immediate attention. The focus should be on establishing a strong foundation.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    With an empty board, the primary strategic goal is to begin building a stable, flat base while ideally setting up for future Tetris (4-line) clears. This usually involves keeping one side of the board clear to create a vertical well for an 'I' piece. Without specific information about the current falling piece (which is likely contained within the 'Aggregate Stats' but is uninterpretable without a key), it's difficult to make a perfectly optimized first move. However, a general approach is to start shifting pieces to one side to maintain a flat profile or begin building the Tetris well.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT",
