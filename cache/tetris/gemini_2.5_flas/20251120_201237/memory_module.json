  "###Action\nRIGHT\n###Thought\nThe primary information available is the \"Column Heights Vector\": `[16, 16, 17, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates that columns 0-2 are high, column 3 has a deep well (height 9), and columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). The \"Aggregate Stats\" is a complex numerical vector and does not clearly provide the current active piece type or its position. The visual analysis is also not available, and the prompt states that the board shown *already* includes the active piece, but no such board representation is given beyond the column heights.\n\nTherefore, I must make a decision without knowing the exact shape or current position of the active falling piece. This significantly limits the ability to make an *optimal* move, as optimality heavily depends on the piece's characteristics.\n\nHowever, I am required to provide an action. My reasoning will be based on general Tetris strategy given the visible board topography:\n1.  **Problem Area:** The deep well in column 3 is a major concern.\n2.  **Opportunity Area:** The completely empty columns 4-9 represent a large, flat area to build upon, potentially setting up for multiple line clears (including Tetris if an I-piece appears).\n3.  **High Area:** Columns 0-2 are quite high, making placements there riskier and less desirable for immediate action.\n\nGiven that I don't know the piece, the most general strategic move to improve the board state is to start utilizing the empty right side (columns 4-9). Tetris pieces typically spawn centered on the board (e.g., spanning columns 3-6 or 4-7). If the piece is currently over the higher left side or the well in C3, moving it `RIGHT` would shift it towards the empty area. This is a common initial step to prepare for building a flat foundation on the right.\n\nMoving `LEFT` would push the piece further into the already high or problematic left side. `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` are risky without knowing the piece's shape and how rotation would affect its placement or orientation relative to the well. `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would place the piece immediately without any intelligent positioning, which is very dangerous when the piece is unknown.\n\nTherefore, moving `RIGHT` is the most reasonable generic first move to initiate building on the wide, empty right side, moving the unknown piece away from the cluttered left side and the well in C3.\n",

  "###Action\nRIGHT\n###Thought\nThe provided `textual_representation` includes a `Board Feature Summary` which shows column heights `[18, 18, 16, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates a severely unbalanced board with high stacks on the left (C0-C3) and a completely empty well on the right (C4-C9). The \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long numerical vector that does not provide an immediately interpretable representation of the active falling piece's shape or current position.\n\nThe prompt states: \"The board shown already includes the active piece. Determine its shape and position.\" However, the `Board Feature Summary` as given represents the *settled* column heights, not a dynamic board state with a falling piece. Without knowing the specific shape and current spawn position of the active piece, it is impossible to plan an truly optimal move.\n\nGiven this critical lack of information, I must choose an action based on general board strategy. The most pressing issue on the board is the massive empty space on the right. The long-term goal is to flatten the board and clear lines. Building up the right side is a logical first step to eventually create opportunities for line clears. Assuming a piece spawns near the center of the board, moving it to the `RIGHT` is a generic action that aims to position the piece towards the large open area, beginning the process of filling the well. This is a heuristic decision, as actual optimality requires knowing the piece.\n",

  "###Action\nRIGHT\n###Thought\nThe primary challenge in this game state is the extreme imbalance of the board. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are critically high (height 19), while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). Column 3 is at a moderate height (9).\n\nA crucial piece of information missing from the `textual_representation` and `Aggregate Stats` is the shape, orientation, and current position of the active falling piece. Without this information, it is impossible to determine an \"optimal\" move in the true sense, as any rotation or specific horizontal movement is purely speculative.\n\nHowever, I am required to choose an action. Given the dangerous heights on the left side of the board, a general strategy is to avoid adding to these columns unless it results in an immediate line clear. Since I don't know the piece, I cannot plan for a line clear.\n\nPieces typically spawn in the upper middle section of the board, often spanning columns 3-6. If a piece spawns in this general area:\n1.  Moving `LEFT` would push the piece towards the dangerously high columns 0-2, which is generally undesirable without a specific line-clearing purpose.\n2.  Moving `RIGHT` would shift the piece towards the empty columns 4-9. This side of the board needs to be built up to eventually create new line-clearing opportunities and balance the board. Placing pieces on the right, even without knowing its exact shape, is a step towards utilizing the vast empty space and away from the immediate threat of topping out on the left.\n3.  `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` would modify the piece's shape. Without knowing the piece, this is a random action that could make placement harder or easier.\n4.  `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP` would commit the piece, which is very risky without knowing its shape and ideal placement.\n5.  `NO_OP` would let the piece fall one step in its current (unknown) configuration, avoiding active misplacement, but also not making any progress towards mitigating the board's imbalance.\n\nBetween these options, and acknowledging the severe information deficit, moving `RIGHT` is a heuristic choice. It pushes the piece away from the critical danger zone (columns 0-2) and towards the area that needs to be developed (columns 4-9), assuming a central spawn. This prioritizes avoiding immediate game over on the left and initiating the necessary structural changes on the right, even if it's a \"blind\" move.\n",

  "###Action\nRIGHT\n###Thought\nThe board is completely empty, as indicated by the `Column Heights Vector` being `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The 'Aggregate Stats' contains a lot of numerical data, but without a key, it's impossible to interpret what '19, 19, 19, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 22, 19' signifies in terms of the current falling piece. However, the `Reflection on Past` section mentions \"without specific information about the current falling piece... it's difficult to make a perfectly optimized first move. However, a general approach is to start shifting pieces to one side to maintain a flat profile or begin building the Tetris well.\"\n\nGiven an empty board and no information about the current piece, a good initial strategy is to move the piece to one side. This prepares for creating a Tetris well (a 4-block high empty column on one side) or simply building a flat foundation. Moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable arbitrary choice to begin this process, as it shifts the piece away from the center, which is often desirable on an empty board. I will assume the piece starts roughly in the middle and moving right is the first step in positioning it.\nthought: The board is currently empty. The `Column Heights Vector` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. There is no visual representation of the falling piece, and the `Aggregate Stats` do not clearly identify the current piece type or its position in a human-readable format. Given this lack of specific information, the most general strategy on an empty board is to begin moving pieces to one side to either create a flat base or set up a Tetris well. Since I cannot see the piece or its orientation, I'll make a conservative move to initiate positioning. Moving `RIGHT` is a reasonable first step to shift the piece away from the center, assuming it starts there.\n"
