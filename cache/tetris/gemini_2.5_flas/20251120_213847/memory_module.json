  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe current game state shows a very uneven board. Columns C0-C3 are high (13-15), while C4-C9 are completely empty. This presents an opportunity to create a deep well on the right side for Tetrises, but first, we need to deal with the active piece.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long vector, but the critical part is the initial `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nLet's deduce the active piece from the changes in the aggregate stats, or rather, from a common understanding of Tetris game states when only this feature vector is given. Since no active piece type or its current position is explicitly given, I must infer. The standard assumption in such scenarios, when only the \"Column Heights Vector\" is provided, is that the active piece has already impacted the board or is not explicitly described in its falling state, and the task is to describe the next 'ideal' *placement* given a *next piece type*. However, the prompt also gives \"Available Actions: NO_OP, LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP\". This implies there *is* an active piece that I need to manipulate.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" portion of the input contains many numbers. It usually represents various board features and *might* contain information about the current piece or next piece. Without a clear legend for these numbers, it's hard to interpret beyond the explicit \"Column Heights Vector\". Let's assume the first few numbers after the column heights are related to the active piece, or that the active piece is implicitly to be inferred from a visual representation (which is N/A here) or a structured textual description (which is also N/A beyond the column heights).\n\nGiven the lack of explicit active piece information in the primary representation, and the absence of a visual analysis or a `processed_visual_description`, I cannot accurately identify the active piece type or its current spawning position. This makes it impossible to plan specific rotations or horizontal movements.\n\nHowever, the problem statement provides examples where the active piece is known (e.g., \"T-piece\", \"J-piece\"). I need to infer. The \"Aggregate Stats\" list is very long. Let me look for patterns or common ways this might encode `Next Piece Type`. Often, a single digit or a specific range of numbers might indicate the piece type. Unfortunately, without a legend, this is impossible to interpret reliably.\n\nSince I cannot know the active piece, I must make a default move or acknowledge this limitation. If forced to choose an action, and assuming a default spawning position (usually top-middle) and a generic piece, the most common immediate action in a heavily uneven board like this is often to adjust horizontally or rotate.\n\nGiven `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is extremely lopsided. The left side is very high and needs to be cleared, while the right side is completely empty.\n\nIf I had to guess the most strategic general action without knowing the piece:\n*   **Avoid immediate HARD_DROP:** Without knowing the piece, dropping it randomly could create more holes or stack higher.\n*   **Rotation:** Essential for placing many pieces, but useless without knowing the piece type.\n*   **Movement (LEFT/RIGHT):** This is for positioning.\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the active piece, I cannot determine an optimal \"Placement_Plan\". I'm in a tricky situation where critical information is missing.\n\nLet's re-read: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" \"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\" \"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\" This implies that the piece *is* known, but the input format does not provide it.\n\nIf the \"Aggregate Stats\" vector is meant to implicitly contain the next piece, without a key, it's unreadable.\nExample of \"Aggregate Stats\" from the prompt: `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 21, 16, 14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nThis seems to contain multiple sets of \"column heights\" or similar features. The prompt itself specifies `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` as the *primary representation*. The Aggregate Stats are listed *after* that.\n\nGiven the primary representation **only** describes the board height, and nothing about the active piece, I am operating under extreme uncertainty.\nHowever, I *must* output a `move`.\n\nLet's assume the question implies I should be able to infer the active piece *somehow* from the `Aggregate Stats`. This is highly problematic without context.\n\nIf I consider the example responses:\n\"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\"\n\"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\"\n\nThese suggest that the piece type *should* be available to me. The most likely source is within the `Aggregate Stats`. Let's assume it's one of the common pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L).\n\nGiven the board: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nA well is formed at C4-C9. A deep well is desirable.\nThe left side is very high. It seems like the goal is to clear lines there. A single line clear on row 13 would be significant.\nA T-piece or L-piece could potentially fill column 3 and some of C0-C2. An I-piece could clear a line.\n\nSince I am unable to determine the current falling piece, making an optimal plan is impossible. I cannot choose between `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT` without knowing the piece's shape and its current orientation and position.\n\nThe prompt states: \"Your task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\" and \"Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\"\nMy `processed_visual_description` is N/A. My `textual_representation` for the board state is `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. It does *not* specify the active piece.\n\nThis is a critical gap in information. I cannot proceed with an \"optimal\" plan.\nWhat should I do in this situation? I am forced to output a `move`.\nA `NO_OP` would mean doing nothing, which is almost never optimal in Tetris.\nAny `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `ROTATE` action would be arbitrary without the piece information.\n\nLet's try to interpret the \"Aggregate Stats\" again, just in case there's an implicit encoding. These vectors are often used to represent many features like `holes`, `roughness`, `cleared lines`, `piece count`, etc. The repetition of patterns like `15, 21, 16` and various heights suggests different board states or projections. The prompt explicitly says `Next Piece Type` is part of these stats, but doesn't tell me *where* it is or *how* it's encoded.\n\nIf I *must* make a move and cannot infer the piece, I will state this limitation. However, the system expects a concrete action.\nLet's consider the most *general* useful thing to do if the board has a huge gap like C4-C9. Often, we want to move pieces towards the empty side to start filling it, or to rotate to fit into existing crevices. But with columns C0-C3 so high, a piece might be constrained on the left.\n\nThe board shape is highly asymmetrical.\n`[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe highest point is 15 at C1 and C2. The goal is to clear lines, especially to reduce C1, C2.\nA common strategy is to try to create a flat surface or a single-column well. Here, there's a natural well on the far right.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, the best I can do is make an educated guess about a common starting strategy. For a very high left side and an empty right side, the general goal would be to move pieces right to start filling the void or to rotate them to create flat surfaces on the left.\nGiven the large gap, a common strategy would be to move pieces right.\nThe height difference is 13 (C3) to 0 (C4). This gap is significant.\n\nIf the piece spawns in the middle (e.g., C3-C6 for a 4-wide piece, or C4-C5 for a 2-wide piece), moving it right would be a general default action to push it towards the empty side.\n\nLet's assume a generic piece spawns in the center, say around columns 3-6.\nThe board needs flattening on the left. If a piece can fit into column 3 to flatten it with C0, C1, C2, that would be good.\nOr if it can be placed to clear a line, that's better.\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot determine the active piece. Therefore, I cannot provide an *optimal* plan. I will have to pick a default action.\nA `RIGHT` move is often a safe initial move to get a piece out of the center spawn and towards one side, especially if there's a large empty area. In this case, the right side is entirely empty.\n\nHowever, moving right might drop a piece into column 4, making it 1 unit high, which is 13 units below column 3. This isn't necessarily bad if it's the start of building a foundation.\n\nSince I *must* provide a \"Placement_Plan\" and a \"move\", and I have no information on the active piece, I will explicitly state this assumption. I cannot deduce it from the provided text.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is an 'I' tetromino, as it's often the most versatile for clearing lines or spanning gaps. If it's an 'I' piece, spawned horizontally, it would occupy 4 columns. Spawned vertically, 1 column, 4 rows.\nIf it spawns at C3-C6 (horizontal I-piece), and the goal is to fill the right side, a `RIGHT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to vertical) would be useful.\nIf it's spawned vertically at C4, it would be [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] as heights. This is not beneficial.\n\nThe situation is that I *cannot* know the piece. I cannot formulate an optimal plan. I need to output *something*.\nIn the absence of a piece, I'll assume the goal is to set up a well. To do that, pieces typically move right.\nLet me make a very basic assumption: if no piece type is given, a `RIGHT` move is a generic exploration/positioning move.\n\nI *need* to state the missing information.\n\"Without explicit identification of the active falling piece (e.g., from `processed_visual_description` or `Aggregate Stats` details), an optimal placement plan cannot be determined.\"\nHowever, the prompt also says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" This suggests that the piece *is* implicitly defined.\n\nWhat if the first number of the `Aggregate Stats` *is* the piece type? `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`. If 15 is a piece ID, what does it map to? Unlikely.\n\nThe problem implies the information exists, and I'm failing to parse it. This is a common challenge in these types of text-based games. The \"Aggregate Stats\" usually contains features, not the direct piece type unless explicitly stated.\n\nLet me try a different angle. The *example* response for \"J-piece needs to be moved left twice\" and \"T-piece needs to be rotated right\" implies that the piece type *is* known at the time of planning. Since my current input explicitly lacks this, I will state that the best I can do is a generic action based on the board shape, assuming a standard piece spawn.\n\nGiven the board: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe critical issue is the empty space on the right (C4-C9) and the high left side (C0-C3).\nTo clear lines on the left, we need pieces to fill those gaps. To prepare for a Tetris on the right, we usually build up columns C4-C8 and leave C9 open, or vice-versa.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, I cannot determine the exact strategy for line clearing or well building.\nI will have to make a very generalized move. A `RIGHT` move is a common first action if a piece spawns centrally and needs to go to the right, which is the \"open\" part of this board.\n\nThis is a scenario where the prompt implicitly expects information that is not explicitly provided in the `textual_representation`.\nI cannot construct a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" without knowing the piece.\nTherefore, I will create a plan that focuses on a generic initial step, making an assumption about the piece's initial position.\n\nAssumption: A piece has spawned centrally and needs to be moved towards the empty right side.\n\nPlan: Move the piece right to start filling the gap or to prepare for a rotation into the main well area. The specific number of `RIGHT` moves or `ROTATIONS` is impossible to determine without the piece type. Thus, the first move is `RIGHT`.\n\nIf the piece starts at columns 3-6 (common for 4-wide pieces) or 4-5 (common for 2-3 wide pieces), a single `RIGHT` move would shift it away from the highest stack on the left and towards the empty area.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' piece. If it spawns horizontally in columns 3-6, and the goal is to drop it down to clear the line at height 13 (C3), it would need to move `LEFT` to C0-C3, or `RIGHT` to C6-C9.\nThe C0-C3 section is very uneven.\n\nThis is very speculative. I need to make a decision. I will explicitly state the lack of piece information.\nGiven the critical information (active piece type and initial orientation/position) is missing, I cannot formulate an *optimal* plan. However, I must output an action. I will choose a 'RIGHT' move as a general attempt to shift any piece towards the empty part of the board, as a common initial step for dealing with a lopsided board. This move, without piece info, is speculative.\nIf I'm forced to generate a `Placement_Plan`, it would be `RIGHT, HARD_DROP` as a placeholder, acknowledging its suboptimality.\n\nThe instruction states: \"The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\"\nThis means I must have a `Placement_Plan`.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an L-piece, spawns in a typical orientation.\nL-piece (standard rotation 0):\nXXX\nX\n(spawns roughly 4th/5th column)\n\nBoard: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nA hole exists at `C3` if we build `C0, C1, C2` to `15`. A `HARD_DROP` in the middle would be detrimental.\n\nThis is a fundamental flaw in the input if the piece is not provided. I'll make a highly speculative plan based on a common scenario.\nOften, the very first action needed is a rotation if the piece is in the wrong orientation, or a lateral move.\n\nLet me default to a `RIGHT` move as a generic action for moving a piece towards the open field on the right. This is a common initial step when the left side is cluttered and the right side is open. It's a move to reposition rather than to place.\n\nFinal thought before execution: The key challenge is the missing active piece type. Without it, *any* specific placement or rotation is a guess. The board suggests moving pieces to the right to start building, or rotating to fit existing gaps/clear lines on the left. Since the left side is very high, moving right to create a cleaner setup on the empty side might be a safer general strategy for the first move, assuming a piece spawns centrally.\nI will assume an 'I' piece as it's fundamental. If an 'I' piece spawns horizontally (4 cells wide), moving it right could position it over C4-C7. If it spawns vertically (1 cell wide), moving it right could position it over C4.\nLet's assume a generic piece needs to be moved `RIGHT` to begin navigating the empty space, without any specific rotation.\nThe `Placement_Plan` would be a sequence of `RIGHT` moves followed by `HARD_DROP` if the piece is to be dropped on the right.\nGiven the current highly uneven board, a `RIGHT` move could be the start of filling the void on the right.\nI cannot make a detailed plan without knowing the piece.\nI'll select `RIGHT`.\nthought: The provided game state only includes the column heights `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and various aggregate stats, but crucially, it does not explicitly state the type, orientation, or current position of the active falling piece. This missing information makes it impossible to formulate an *optimal* and precise placement plan.\n\nHowever, I am required to provide a `Placement_Plan` and an immediate `move`. Given the highly unbalanced board, with columns C0-C3 being high and columns C4-C9 being completely empty, a common strategic initial move is to direct the falling piece towards the empty side of the board. This allows for building a stable foundation on the right, potentially for a Tetris well, or simply to get the piece out of the way of the high stacks on the left.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, I will make a generic assumption that the piece spawns in a central-top location (e.g., around columns 3-6) and that a `RIGHT` movement is a reasonable first step to begin positioning it over the empty columns. This is a general exploratory move rather than a targeted optimal placement.

  "###Action\nRIGHT\n###Thought\nThe most critical aspect of the current game state is the severely imbalanced board, with columns 0-3 at dangerous heights (17, 17, 15, 13) and columns 4-9 completely empty. This makes the left side a high-risk area for topping out.\n\nA major limitation is that the current falling piece (and next pieces) are not explicitly stated in the provided `textual_representation`. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate a truly \"optimal\" plan involving rotations and precise placements to clear lines or build specific structures.\n\nHowever, I must still provide a move and a `Placement_Plan`. Given the high stack on the left and the empty space on the right, the safest and most strategically sound general action for *any* unknown piece is to move it away from the dangerous left side and towards the open right side. This minimizes the risk of topping out immediately.\n\nAssuming the piece spawns near the center, moving it to the right will shift it into the empty columns (4-9). Repeatedly moving right would eventually place it against the right wall or in columns 7-9, which is the least obstructed area.\n\nTherefore, the immediate optimal action, under the constraint of an unknown piece, is to initiate movement to the right. The full \"Placement_Plan\" would ideally involve moving the piece to the rightmost available columns to build a new foundation, though its exact position and any necessary rotations cannot be determined without the piece type. For this single step, a simple `RIGHT` move is the best option.\n\nPlacement_Plan: (Piece type unknown, general strategy is to move right to avoid high stack on left. Move right repeatedly until desired column is reached, then hard drop.) Initial step: RIGHT.\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe primary challenge in this game state is the critically high columns on the left: C0=19, C1=19, C2=18. These columns are one or two blocks away from game over. Columns C4-C9 are completely empty, and C3 is at 13.\n\nCrucially, the current active falling piece and the next piece are **not provided** in the `Current Game State (primary representation)`, `Aggregate Stats`, or `Game Trajectory`. The prompt states \"identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces\" from the available information, but this information is absent. The \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long, undifferentiated list of numbers, and without a schema, it's impossible to deduce the active piece type or its current position from it.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, its shape, or its current orientation and spawn position, it is impossible to formulate an optimal \"Placement_Plan\" or even an informed next \"move\". Any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) would be a blind guess and highly likely to lead to a worse state or immediate game over given the precarious board.\n\nSince I am required to provide a `move` action, and I cannot logically determine an optimal action without the piece information, I will choose `NO_OP`. This action simply lets the piece fall by one row, effectively passing the turn without committing to any horizontal movement or rotation. While not strategic, it is the least committal action when playing completely blind, allowing for a potential re-evaluation if the piece becomes visible or if this action somehow reveals more information in the next turn (though this is unlikely given the current input format). Hard dropping or soft dropping without knowing the piece is extremely risky at this critical board height.\n\nPlacement_Plan: [Cannot formulate a plan without knowing the active piece.]\n",

  "###Action\nHARD_DROP\n###Thought\nThe primary representation of the board state, the \"Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", indicates that the board is completely empty. The \"Aggregate Stats\" section is extremely long and does not clearly specify the current falling piece or next pieces in a standard, parsable format (e.g., \"N:I\" or similar). This is critical missing information for optimal planning.\n\nGiven that the board is empty and the active piece is not explicitly provided, I must make a reasonable assumption to provide a \"Placement_Plan\" and a \"move\". In standard Tetris, the first piece of a new game spawns at the top-middle of the board. A common starting strategy for an empty board is to create a flat base to maximize future line clear opportunities and minimize holes.\n\nI will assume the falling piece is an I-tetromino (the 4-block straight line). This is a common starting piece, and its default horizontal orientation typically spans columns 3, 4, 5, and 6. On an empty board, placing this piece in its default spawn position by hard dropping it would create a perfectly flat, low base (height 1 across 4 columns), which is an optimal initial move for setting up the game. No rotation or horizontal movement is needed for this specific piece in this context to achieve a good starting position.\n\nPlacement_Plan: HARD_DROP\n",

  "###Action\nSOFT_DROP\n###Thought\nI have received the board state (Column Heights Vector) but no information about the current falling piece or any upcoming pieces. Without knowing the active piece, its shape, and its initial orientation, it is impossible to formulate an optimal \"Placement_Plan\" involving rotations or specific horizontal movements. The board is largely empty on the right side.\n\nIn the absence of piece information, the most neutral and generally safe action is to `SOFT_DROP`. This allows the piece to fall one row, advancing the game state without making any potentially incorrect rotational or horizontal adjustments. A `HARD_DROP` would be too committal. `NO_OP` would simply stall for a single frame, which is less productive than a soft drop. Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` or `ROTATING` would be pure guesswork. Therefore, `SOFT_DROP` is the best choice to move the game forward given the lack of information.\nPlacement_Plan: SOFT_DROP\n"
