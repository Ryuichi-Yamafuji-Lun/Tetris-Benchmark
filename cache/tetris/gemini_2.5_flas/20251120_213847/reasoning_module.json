    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context available, so a comparison to prior states is not possible.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, the effectiveness of any past move cannot be evaluated.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is currently very low, with blocks only in the first three columns: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. There's a slight unevenness with column 0 being height 2 and columns 1 and 2 being height 1. This creates a small \"dip\" or potential hole if column 0 continues to rise significantly faster than its neighbors. The rest of the board (columns 3-9) is completely clear.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The board is in an excellent, very low and open state. The primary strategy should be to maintain this low profile and flatness, while ideally building towards a Tetris setup on the right side (columns 3-9 are perfectly clear). Carefully place incoming pieces to minimize height differences, avoid creating new holes, and keep a clean well for line clears. Prioritize filling the small dip between columns 0 and 1-2 without raising column 0 too much, or build up evenly.",
    "response": "thought: The game state is extremely ambiguous as the current active piece and next pieces are not explicitly stated in an interpretable format. The \"Aggregate Stats\" are a large vector of numerical values, likely representing encoded board states and scores for various hypothetical placements, rather than a direct description of the current falling piece.\n\nHowever, the \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" is clear. This indicates a very low board with a slight unevenness on the left (column 0 at height 2, columns 1 and 2 at height 1), and columns 3-9 completely clear.\n\nGiven the lack of information about the active piece, I must choose an action that is generally beneficial or at least not harmful in most scenarios. The overall strategy should be to maintain a low and flat board, preferably building towards a Tetris well on the right side, as it is perfectly clear.\n\nMoving `RIGHT` is a reasonable initial action. It would shift any incoming piece away from the existing, slightly uneven structure on the left (columns 0-2) and towards the entirely clear, flat expanse on the right (columns 3-9). This aligns with the strategy of building a flat base on the right side and maintaining the current low profile. Without knowing the piece, a specific rotation or precise horizontal placement plan is impossible, so a directional move to initiate positioning is the most logical choice.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

This creates a significant drop-off from C3 to C4. Attention should be paid to maintaining a clear path on the right for potential Tetris line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current board state is ideal for setting up a Tetris (4-line clear) by placing pieces on the left and dropping an 'I' piece vertically into the wide open gap on the right. Future moves should prioritize keeping the rightmost columns (C4-C9) as clear as possible, especially C9, to accommodate a vertical 'I' piece. If no 'I' piece is available, maintain the flatness on the left and extend the stack horizontally without creating internal holes.",

This creates a very deep, wide \"well\" on the right side of the board.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to fill in the large empty space on the right side (columns C4-C9) to level out the board. This involves carefully placing incoming pieces to build up the right columns, ideally creating a flat surface or a single-column well for Tetris clears. Avoid building higher on the left side (C0-C3) unless necessary to clear lines, as this would exacerbate the imbalance. The current board state is stable with plenty of vertical space.",
    "response": "thought: The board state shows columns C0 and C1 at height 5, C2 and C3 at height 3, and C4-C9 are empty. This is a very open board, and the goal is to level it out by filling the right side.\n\nThe aggregate stats provided a very long list of numbers, which likely represents the full board state row by row or some other detailed feature vector. I need to infer the current falling piece. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as \"active piece\" or \"current piece\", I have to assume that the 'Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]' reflects the state *after* the previous piece has landed, and the \"Aggregate Stats\" or some other implicit information should tell me about the *current* falling piece.\n\nHowever, the \"Aggregate Stats\" are a long list of numbers and do not clearly indicate the *current* falling piece or *next* piece. In previous examples, \"Next Piece Type\" was explicitly mentioned. Without explicit information on the current falling piece, I cannot plan its placement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the prompt: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" and \"Current Game State (primary representation): Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\".\n\nThere is no mention of the *current falling piece* in the `Board Feature Summary` or the `Aggregate Stats`. The `Aggregate Stats` is a long list of numbers with no clear labels for what piece is falling. This is a critical missing piece of information for planning.\n\nGiven the constraints, I must provide *an* action. If I don't know the piece, any action is essentially a guess. I should default to a NO_OP or a move that doesn't immediately cause an issue.\n\nHowever, typically in Tetris game states provided, the active piece is either explicitly stated or embedded in the board representation. The provided textual representation only gives column heights and a very long \"Aggregate Stats\" vector.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that the \"Aggregate Stats\" *implicitly* contain the current piece information, but I cannot parse it. In a real Tetris game, a piece is always falling. Since I don't know *what* piece is falling, I cannot formulate an optimal plan.\n\nIf I *had* to pick an action without knowing the piece, a `NO_OP` is the safest in the short term, as it won't immediately misplace a piece. However, the task is to plan the *optimal* next move, which requires knowing the active piece.\n\nLet's check the example: \"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\" This implies the piece *is* known. My input lacks this crucial information.\n\nGiven the missing information, I cannot make an \"optimal\" plan. I must highlight this limitation. I will assume the prompt *expects* me to deduce the active piece from the \"Aggregate Stats\" or there's an implicit understanding of what the active piece is from the \"Game Trajectory\" section, but that section only shows the *same textual representation* again, not an actual trajectory or explicit active piece data.\n\nI will state that the active piece is unknown and thus a specific optimal plan cannot be formed. However, since I *must* output an action, I will output `NO_OP` as a placeholder, while emphasizing the lack of information.\n\nIf I were to make an assumption:\nThe board is low on the right (C4-C9 empty).\nIf the goal is to fill the right side, a piece will likely need to move right.\nWithout knowing the piece shape, I cannot even tell if a rotation is needed.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Aggregate Stats\" again. It's a very long vector. Could it be a flattened 2D array of the board with the piece on it?\nThe first part of the Aggregate Stats is: `[5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nThe column heights are `[5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\nIf we assume a 10-column board.\nThe numbers `5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0` are 10 numbers. If these are the *current* heights *including the falling piece*, then the piece is somewhere in columns 0-6.\n`[5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]` - This looks *very* similar to the column heights, but with C1 height 4 and C0 height 5. This would imply a piece affecting column 1.\n\nLet's assume the provided \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" is the *current* state of the *fixed* blocks, and the active piece *has not yet been placed on this board representation*. This is a standard way to represent the 'well' before a piece drops.\n\nWithout a shape and its initial spawn position, I cannot plan optimally. I will explicitly state this. To fulfill the prompt requirements for an action, I will choose `NO_OP` as the safest, least damaging action in a state of uncertainty.\n\nIf I *must* guess a piece or find it:\nThe `Aggregate Stats` list is very long. `[5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nThis seems like it might be board rows (heights per column if transposed, or perhaps row data).\nIf it's the board state *with* the piece, how do I differentiate?\nThe length of the Aggregate Stats `5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...` is 300 elements long. If it's a 20x10 board, that would be 200 elements. Could it be multiple board states, or a very dense feature vector? The repeated sequences suggest it's more like a detailed representation of the board state *over time* or a very complex feature vector, but not *directly* identifying the active piece.\n\nGiven the prompt states \"Current Game State (primary representation): Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\", this *is* the primary representation. The \"Aggregate Stats\" is secondary. Neither of these explicitly mention the active piece.\n\nI *cannot* make an optimal plan without knowing the active falling piece. This is a fundamental requirement for playing Tetris. I will provide a `NO_OP` move as it is the only safe move when the current piece is unknown.\n\n**Self-correction:** The prompt asks me to \"plan the optimal next move\". Not knowing the piece makes \"optimal\" impossible. However, I *must* provide an action. The most reasonable approach is to highlight the missing information and then pick the most neutral action (`NO_OP`).\n\nIf I were forced to infer the piece and its position from the `Aggregate Stats` based on patterns:\nThe first part `[5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` - if these were column heights *including* the piece, then C1 would be 4 instead of 5, which means a block was removed from C1 (impossible as blocks fall down), or a piece is filling *into* C1 but not yet landed. This interpretation doesn't seem right.\n\nThe repeated patterns `5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0` and similar variations throughout the `Aggregate Stats` make me believe this is not a direct representation of the current piece on the board, but perhaps some complex encoded feature representation.\n\nTherefore, the active piece remains unknown.\nThe board has a large well on the right. If I had an I-piece or an L/J/T piece, I would want to fill that well.\nWithout knowing the piece, I cannot determine rotations or horizontal movements.\n\nI will state clearly the assumption that the active piece is unknown and thus the plan is based on that limitation.\nThe prompt requires a \"Placement_Plan\" and a \"move\". If the piece is unknown, a full \"Placement_Plan\" is impossible. I will treat \"NO_OP\" as the entire \"Placement_Plan\" in this edge case.\nthought: The primary information provided for the current game state is the `Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [5, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This vector indicates the current height of the piled-up blocks in each column. Columns 0 and 1 are at height 5, columns 2 and 3 are at height 3, and columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a large, deep well on the right side of the board.\n\nCrucially, the provided game state description does *not* explicitly state what the current active falling piece is (e.g., I-piece, T-piece, J-piece, etc.) nor its initial orientation or spawn position. The \"Aggregate Stats\" are a very long, unlabelled list of numbers that do not provide clear information about the active piece. Without knowing the shape and type of the current falling piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan or even a meaningful first move beyond a NO_OP. Any other action (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) would be a blind guess that could potentially worsen the board state or lead to a suboptimal placement.\n\nTherefore, given the critical absence of information regarding the active falling piece, the only responsible action is to perform a `NO_OP`. This allows the piece to descend one step, potentially revealing its shape or allowing for a subsequent observation to provide the missing information. An optimal plan cannot be created without knowing the piece.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nWithout previous context, it is impossible to determine how the board has changed or what the last move was.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout previous context, it is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or thought process.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe board is extremely unbalanced. Columns C0, C1, and C2 are very high (10, 10, 11 units respectively), while columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (0 units). Column C3 is at a moderate height (3 units). The primary area needing attention is the entire left side of the board (C0-C2), which is dangerously high and likely contains holes (though specific hole counts aren't directly clear from the provided features). The completely empty right side (C4-C9) is a significant opportunity but also highlights a critical misplay in current board management.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe immediate strategic priority is to address the severe height imbalance. Avoid placing any more pieces on C0-C2 unless they directly result in a clear. The empty right side (C4-C9) offers a blank canvas; pieces should be strategically placed there to build a more stable and level base, potentially setting up for future Tetris clears or at least horizontal clears to reduce the overall height variation. The goal should be to bring the right side's height up to a manageable level while trying to find opportunities to clear lines on the left. This board state indicates a significant issue with horizontal balance that must be corrected.",
    "response": "thought: The current game state shows a very uneven board, with columns C0-C2 being high (10, 10, 11) and C3 at height 3, while C4-C9 are completely empty (0). The provided \"Aggregate Stats\" is a very long numerical vector that seems to encode more than just aggregate stats, possibly the full board state in a very dense format. Without a clearer interpretation or a visual representation of the board and the *current falling piece*, it is extremely difficult to determine an optimal move.\n\nThe \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [10, 10, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" is the most actionable piece of information.\nThe critical issue is the lack of information about the *current falling piece*. Without knowing its shape and orientation, I cannot formulate a specific placement plan.\n\nGiven the extreme imbalance, a general strategy would be to:\n1. Prioritize filling the empty columns C4-C9 to create a more level playing field and avoid creating a deep well that would be hard to recover from.\n2. Avoid adding height to C0-C2 unless it results in a line clear.\n\nSince I don't know the current piece, I cannot determine rotations or specific horizontal movements. The problem states \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" but the current piece information is missing from the *primary representation* and *aggregate stats* (it's not specified if 'next piece type' means the *current* falling piece or the *next* piece in the queue, and even if it did, the type is not explicitly given in a human-readable format). The prompt says \"infer from `textual_representation`\" but the information for the *current piece* is absent.\n\nThe example response implies I should know the active piece (e.g., \"The current J-piece\"). Since this information is missing, I cannot perform a specific optimal placement.\n\nHowever, I must provide *an* action. In the absence of specific piece information, I cannot make an \"optimal\" decision for placement. The only safe move, if I cannot make any specific placement decision, is `NO_OP` to wait for more information or for the piece to potentially be identifiable by its falling behavior (which is not relevant for a single-step decision).\n\nLet's re-examine \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [11, 10, 12, 12, 12, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 11, 12, 10, 10, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 9, 10, 8, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 9, 16, 8, 10, 10, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 15, 14, 8, 11, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 9, 14, 8, 11, 11, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 17, 14, 8, 9, 11, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 13, 14, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 21, 12, 8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 11, 10, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 23, 12, 8, 9, 8, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 11, 10, 8, 9, 8, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 14, 12, 8, 9, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 10, 8, 9, 8, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 16, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 12, 8, 9, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 9, 8, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 10, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 9, 8, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 9, 8, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 10, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 10, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 9, 8, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 9, 8, 12, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 10, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 10, 12, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 9, 8, 15, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 9, 10, 13, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]\". This very long list of numbers is highly unlikely to directly contain the current piece type in a discernible way without a clear mapping. It looks like a series of feature vectors over time or different aspects, some of which may indicate the board state, but not the current piece. The prompt states \"Next Piece Type\" is one of the \"Aggregate Stats\", but it doesn't give a type.\n\nSince I am forced to output an action, and I have absolutely no information about the current falling piece, I cannot perform any meaningful rotation or horizontal movement. The only safe action is `NO_OP`, which allows the piece to fall naturally, and hopefully, more information will be available in the next turn's observation. If I were to guess a placement without knowing the piece, it would be purely random and likely suboptimal. Thus, `NO_OP` is the only logically sound choice when vital information is missing.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" This implies that *all necessary information* to make an optimal move *is present* somewhere in the provided text.\nLet's re-read carefully: \"Current Game State (primary representation): Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [10, 10, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [11, 10, 12, ...]\"\n\nThe phrasing \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)\" suggests that 'Next Piece Type' *is* part of this aggregate stat vector. However, there is no key/value pair for 'Next Piece Type' or 'Current Piece Type' followed by its specific shape (e.g., 'I', 'O', 'T', 'J', 'L', 'S', 'Z'). The long vector of numbers is just that: numbers.\n\nIf I *must* infer the piece type, and it's not explicitly stated, this is an impossible task. The system expects a specific action for a specific piece.\nPerhaps the \"N/A\" for \"Visual Analysis\" is a clue that I should be able to deduce the piece from the textual representation, but it is not explicitly provided.\n\nGiven the strict format requirement \"move: [chosen_action_string]\", and the inability to discern the current piece, I have to assume that the 'optimal' next move depends on a piece that I cannot identify. This is a critical failure in the problem description or my interpretation.\n\nLet's assume there's a convention where the first few numbers in \"Aggregate Stats\" *encode* the current piece. Without that convention being explicitly stated, I cannot decode it.\n\nIf I absolutely *must* choose an action other than `NO_OP`, it would be a random guess. However, the goal is \"optimal\".\n\nThe instruction \"Infer from textual_representation\" is key. But what implies the current piece? The \"Board Feature Summary\" is just the final height. \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long list of numbers. There is no line like \"Current Piece: I\" or \"Next Piece: T\".\n\nOkay, I need to make an assumption to proceed, as `NO_OP` might be considered not \"optimal\" if an action *can* be taken. What if \"Next Piece Type\" refers to the *current* falling piece? But even then, what value in the long vector corresponds to it? And what does that value mean?\n\nThis is a problem where crucial information (the active tetromino) is missing from the provided input description. If the system expects an 'optimal' move, it must provide the active piece.\n\nLet's consider if a specific piece could lead to the provided \"Column Heights Vector\" and if one piece is implied. This is a very complex inverse problem.\n\nSince I cannot identify the piece, I cannot create a \"Placement_Plan\". I am forced to pick *some* action. What is the least harmful action in such a state?\n- `LEFT` or `RIGHT`: Moves the piece, possibly into a worse position if it's the wrong piece.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`: Rotates the piece, again, could be bad.\n- `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP`: Immediately places the piece, which is disastrous without knowing the piece.\n- `NO_OP`: Does nothing, the piece falls one step. This is the only safe option if the piece is unknown, as it gives more time for information to appear (though not in this single-turn observation).\n\nGiven the context of an AI assistant playing Tetris, the expectation is to always make a calculated move. If a piece is falling, the system implicitly expects me to interact with it. The absence of an identified piece is a critical flaw in the input.\n\nHowever, let me consider the \"Aggregate Stats\" again.

For example, `[..., 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]` appears often. The `19` values are also interesting, they might denote full rows or boundaries.\nHowever, none of this explicitly translates to \"Current Piece: L-Block\".\n\nSince the problem requires a plan, and an action, I cannot simply say \"I don't know the piece\". I must operate under the assumption that the necessary information *should* be there, and if it's not interpretable, then the safest non-committal action is `NO_OP`.\n\nHowever, the \"Reflection on Past\" section hints that I *should* know the current piece, as it talks about \"the current J-piece\" in the example response. This implies I'm failing to extract it.\n\nCould \"Next Piece Type\" be a single number in the initial part of the long aggregate stats vector? For example, if the first `11` represents holes, `10` roughness, then perhaps `12` is the piece type? If so, what does `12` map to? Without a lookup table, it's impossible.\n\nI have to choose an action. Given the very high left columns and empty right columns, a general strategy is to fill the right side.\nIf I assume, for the sake of making a concrete plan, that the *current piece* is one that can easily be placed on the right side. For instance, an 'I' piece (straight line) could fit vertically in C4-C7, or horizontally in C4-C9 (if it's not too high). A 'T' or 'O' or 'L' or 'J' piece would also fit easily on the right side.\n\nSince the goal is to *level* the board, moving pieces to the right is generally good. Moving one step `RIGHT` is a reasonable first step if the piece is currently centered (usually start position is center of board, columns 3-6).\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' tetromino, starting at the top-center.\nIf it's an 'I' piece and I want to fill the right side (C4-C9), I would rotate it to be horizontal and move it to the rightmost possible position to fill columns C6-C9. Or, if vertical, I would move it to C4 and drop it. This would depend on the next pieces.\nGiven that the board is empty from C4 to C9, any piece moved to the right is likely to be a good first step towards leveling.\n\nSo, *if I were forced to make a non-`NO_OP` move without knowing the piece*, I would choose `RIGHT` as a generic move to try to position *any* piece towards the empty right side of the board. This is a heuristic, not an optimal plan based on knowing the piece.\n\nLet's be explicit: I cannot determine the current piece from the provided information. Therefore, I cannot formulate an \"optimal\" plan. The prompt is flawed in this regard.\nHowever, I must provide *a* move. I will explicitly state this assumption.\n\nIf I were to pick a piece arbitrarily, say, a square (O-piece). It could be placed in C4-C5, C5-C6, etc. If it were a straight piece (I-piece), it could fill C4-C7 vertically, or C6-C9 horizontally.\nTo begin leveling, placing pieces on the right seems strategically sound.\nA `RIGHT` move shifts the piece towards this empty area.\n\nFinal strategy for this impossible situation:\n1. Acknowledge the missing piece information.\n2. State that an optimal plan is impossible without it.\n3. Choose the least harmful or generally beneficial first step, which in this case is to try to move the piece towards the empty right side of the board. `RIGHT` achieves this.\n4. I cannot create a full `Placement_Plan` without knowing the piece. I will just state the single action.\n\nLet's assume the typical spawn point for a piece is centered (columns 3/4 and 4/5). Moving `RIGHT` once or twice would shift it to columns C5/C6 or C6/C7, which are within the empty region.\n\nFor the `Placement_Plan`, since I don't know the piece, I cannot specify rotations. I can only make a best guess about horizontal movement. If the piece starts centered, `RIGHT` is a good first step to try and guide it towards columns C4-C9.\nPerhaps the model is expected to infer the piece from the 'Aggregate Stats' vector, but without a clear decoding guide, it's impossible. I will proceed with the assumption that the current piece is unknown and choose a universally applicable action. The `HARD_DROP` and `SOFT_DROP` actions are for immediate placement, which would be terrible without knowing the piece. `NO_OP` is the safest, but might not be what the system expects if it assumes I *can* determine the piece.\n\nGiven the instructions \"Your goal is to help place pieces optimally to clear lines and avoid stacking too high,\" and \"The primary area needing attention is the entire left side of the board (C0-C2), which is dangerously high and likely contains holes... The completely empty right side (C4-C9) is a significant opportunity...\", the best first step *towards* a strategy, even without knowing the piece, is to attempt to move it away from the high columns and towards the empty ones.\n\nThus, moving `RIGHT` is the most logical \"first step\" of a plan to fill the empty columns on the right, assuming the piece starts somewhere in the middle.\n\nSince I am restricted to one action, and cannot complete a `Placement_Plan` without knowing the piece, I will state that the plan is incomplete.\nIf I put `RIGHT`, it implies a piece is there, and I want to move it right. This is the most reasonable assumption for an optimal play in the absence of precise info on the current piece.\nthought: The primary challenge in this game state is the extreme imbalance of the board, with columns C0-C2 being very high (10, 10, 11) and columns C4-C9 being completely empty (0). Column C3 is at height 3.\n\nA critical piece of information is missing: the identity of the current falling piece. Without knowing the shape and orientation of the active tetromino, it is impossible to formulate a truly \"optimal\" placement plan involving rotations and precise horizontal movements. The provided \"Aggregate Stats\" does not explicitly state the current or next piece type in a discernible format.\n\nHowever, I must provide an action. Given the board's state, the overarching strategic goal should be to level the board by filling the empty right side (C4-C9) and avoiding adding height to the already dangerous left side (C0-C2).\n\nAssuming the active piece spawns in a typical center position (e.g., around columns 3-6), moving it to the right is the most logical initial step towards positioning it over the empty columns. This minimizes the risk of increasing the height on the high left side and initiates a movement towards the advantageous open area.\n\nSince I cannot determine rotations or specific final placements without knowing the piece, a full \"Placement_Plan\" cannot be provided. The immediate action is to move the piece to the right, beginning the process of shifting it to the empty side of the board.\n\nPlacement_Plan: (Unable to formulate a full plan without knowing the current piece. The intention is to move the piece towards the right side of the board to start filling the empty columns.)\nmove: RIGHT",
    "thought": "The current game state shows a very uneven board, with columns C0-C2 being high (10, 10, 11) and C3 at height 3, while C4-C9 are completely empty (0). The provided \"Aggregate Stats\" is a very long numerical vector that seems to encode more than just aggregate stats, possibly the full board state in a very dense format. Without a clearer interpretation or a visual representation of the board and the *current falling piece*, it is extremely difficult to determine an optimal move.\n\nThe \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [10, 10, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\" is the most actionable piece of information.\nThe critical issue is the lack of information about the *current falling piece*. Without knowing its shape and orientation, I cannot formulate a specific placement plan.\n\nGiven the extreme imbalance, a general strategy would be to:\n1. Prioritize filling the empty columns C4-C9 to create a more level playing field and avoid creating a deep well that would be hard to recover from.\n2. Avoid adding height to C0-C2 unless it results in a line clear.\n\nSince I don't know the current piece, I cannot determine rotations or specific horizontal movements. The problem states \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" but the current piece information is missing from the *primary representation* and *aggregate stats* (it's not specified if 'next piece type' means the *current* falling piece or the *next* piece in the queue, and even if it did, the type is not explicitly given in a human-readable format). The prompt says \"infer from `textual_representation`\" but the information for the *current piece* is absent.\n\nThe example response implies I should know the active piece (e.g., \"The current J-piece\"). Since this information is missing, I cannot perform a specific optimal placement.\n\nHowever, I must provide *an* action. In the absence of specific piece information, I cannot make an \"optimal\" decision for placement. The only safe move, if I cannot make any specific placement decision, is `NO_OP` to wait for more information or for the piece to potentially be identifiable by its falling behavior (which is not relevant for a single-step decision).\n\nLet's re-examine \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [11, 10, 12, 12, 12, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 11, 12, 10, 10, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 9, 10, 8, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 9, 16, 8, 10, 10, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 15, 14, 8, 11, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 9, 14, 8, 11, 11, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 17, 14, 8, 9, 11, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11, 13, 14, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 21, 12, 8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 11, 10, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 23, 12, 8, 9, 8, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 11, 10, 8, 9, 8, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 14, 12, 8, 9, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 10, 8, 9, 8, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 16, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 12, 8, 9, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 10, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 9, 8, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 10, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 10, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 9, 8, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 9, 8, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 10, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 10, 14, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 9, 8, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 9, 8, 12, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 10, 16, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 10, 12, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 9, 8, 15, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 8, 9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 9, 10, 13, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 0, 0]\". This very long list of numbers is highly unlikely to directly contain the current piece type in a discernible way without a clear mapping. It looks like a series of feature vectors over time or different aspects, some of which may indicate the board state, but not the current piece. The prompt states \"Next Piece Type\" is one of the \"Aggregate Stats\", but it doesn't give a type.\n\nSince I am forced to output an action, and I have absolutely no information about the current falling piece, I cannot perform any meaningful rotation or horizontal movement. The only safe action is `NO_OP`, which allows the piece to fall naturally, and hopefully, more information will be available in the next turn's observation. If I were to guess a placement without knowing the piece, it would be purely random and likely suboptimal. Thus, `NO_OP` is the only logically sound choice when vital information is missing.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" This implies that *all necessary information* to make an optimal move *is present* somewhere in the provided text.\nLet's re-read carefully: \"Current Game State (primary representation): Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [10, 10, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [11, 10, 12, ...]\"\n\nThe phrasing \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)\" suggests that 'Next Piece Type' *is* part of this aggregate stat vector. However, there is no key/value pair for 'Next Piece Type' or 'Current Piece Type' followed by its specific shape (e.g., 'I', 'O', 'T', 'J', 'L', 'S', 'Z'). The long vector of numbers is just that: numbers.\n\nIf I *must* infer the piece type, and it's not explicitly stated, this is an impossible task. The system expects a specific action for a specific piece.\nPerhaps the \"N/A\" for \"Visual Analysis\" is a clue that I should be able to deduce the piece from the textual representation, but it is not explicitly provided.\n\nGiven the strict format requirement \"move: [chosen_action_string]\", and the inability to discern the current piece, I have to assume that the 'optimal' next move depends on a piece that I cannot identify. This is a critical failure in the problem description or my interpretation.\n\nLet's assume there's a convention where the first few numbers in \"Aggregate Stats\" *encode* the current piece. Without that convention being explicitly stated, I cannot decode it.\n\nIf I absolutely *must* choose an action other than `NO_OP`, it would be a random guess. However, the goal is \"optimal\".\n\nThe instruction \"Infer from textual_representation\" is key. But what implies the current piece? The \"Board Feature Summary\" is just the final height. \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long list of numbers. There is no line like \"Current Piece: I\" or \"Next Piece: T\".\n\nOkay, I need to make an assumption to proceed, as `NO_OP` might be considered not \"optimal\" if an action *can* be taken. What if \"Next Piece Type\" refers to the *current* falling piece? But even then, what value in the long vector corresponds to it? And what does that value mean?\n\nThis is a problem where crucial information (the active tetromino) is missing from the provided input description. If the system expects an 'optimal' move, it must provide the active piece.\n\nLet's consider if a specific piece could lead to the provided \"Column Heights Vector\" and if one piece is implied. This is a very complex inverse problem.\n\nSince I cannot identify the piece, I cannot create a \"Placement_Plan\". I am forced to pick *some* action. What is the least harmful action in such a state?\n- `LEFT` or `RIGHT`: Moves the piece, possibly into a worse position if it's the wrong piece.\n- `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`: Rotates the piece, again, could be bad.\n- `SOFT_DROP` or `HARD_DROP`: Immediately places the piece, which is disastrous without knowing the piece.\n- `NO_OP`: Does nothing, the piece falls one step. This is the only safe option if the piece is unknown, as it gives more time for information to appear (though not in this single-turn observation).\n\nGiven the context of an AI assistant playing Tetris, the expectation is to always make a calculated move. If a piece is falling, the system implicitly expects me to interact with it.

For example, `[..., 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]` appears often. The `19` values are also interesting, they might denote full rows or boundaries.\nHowever, none of this explicitly translates to \"Current Piece: L-Block\".\n\nSince the problem requires a plan, and an action, I cannot simply say \"I don't know the piece\". I must operate under the assumption that the necessary information *should* be there, and if it's not interpretable, then the safest non-committal action is `NO_OP`.\n\nHowever, the \"Reflection on Past\" section hints that I *should* know the current piece, as it talks about \"the current J-piece\" in the example response. This implies I'm failing to extract it.\n\nCould \"Next Piece Type\" be a single number in the initial part of the long aggregate stats vector? For example, if the first `11` represents holes, `10` roughness, then perhaps `12` is the piece type? If so, what does `12` map to? Without a lookup table, it's impossible.\n\nI have to choose an action. Given the very high left columns and empty right columns, a general strategy is to fill the right side.\nIf I assume, for the sake of making a concrete plan, that the *current piece* is one that can easily be placed on the right side. For instance, an 'I' piece (straight line) could fit vertically in C4-C7, or horizontally in C4-C9 (if it's not too high). A 'T' or 'O' or 'L' or 'J' piece would also fit easily on the right side.\n\nSince the goal is to *level* the board, moving pieces to the right is generally good. Moving one step `RIGHT` is a reasonable first step if the piece is currently centered (usually start position is center of board, columns 3-6).\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' tetromino, starting at the top-center.\nIf it's an 'I' piece and I want to fill the right side (C4-C9), I would rotate it to be horizontal and move it to the rightmost possible position to fill columns C6-C9. Or, if vertical, I would move it to C4 and drop it. This would depend on the next pieces.\nGiven that the board is empty from C4 to C9, any piece moved to the right is likely to be a good first step towards leveling.\n\nSo, *if I were forced to make a non-`NO_OP` move without knowing the piece*, I would choose `RIGHT` as a generic move to try to position *any* piece towards the empty right side of the board. This is a heuristic, not an optimal plan based on knowing the piece.\n\nLet's be explicit: I cannot determine the current piece from the provided information. Therefore, I cannot formulate an \"optimal\" plan. The prompt is flawed in this regard.\nHowever, I must provide *a* move. I will explicitly state this assumption.\n\nIf I were to pick a piece arbitrarily, say, a square (O-piece). It could be placed in C4-C5, C5-C6, etc. If it were a straight piece (I-piece), it could fill C4-C7 vertically, or C6-C9 horizontally.\nTo begin leveling, placing pieces on the right seems strategically sound.\nA `RIGHT` move shifts the piece towards this empty area.\n\nFinal strategy for this impossible situation:\n1. Acknowledge the missing piece information.\n2. State that an optimal plan is impossible without it.\n3. Choose the least harmful or generally beneficial first step, which in this case is to try to move the piece towards the empty right side of the board. `RIGHT` achieves this.\n4. I cannot create a full `Placement_Plan` without knowing the piece. I will just state the single action.\n\nLet's assume the typical spawn point for a piece is centered (columns 3/4 and 4/5). Moving `RIGHT` once or twice would shift it to columns C5/C6 or C6/C7, which are within the empty region.\n\nFor the `Placement_Plan`, since I don't know the piece, I cannot specify rotations. I can only make a best guess about horizontal movement. If the piece starts centered, `RIGHT` is a good first step to try and guide it towards columns C4-C9.\nPerhaps the model is expected to infer the piece from the 'Aggregate Stats' vector, but without a clear decoding guide, it's impossible. I will proceed with the assumption that the current piece is unknown and choose a universally applicable action. The `HARD_DROP` and `SOFT_DROP` actions are for immediate placement, which would be terrible without knowing the piece. `NO_OP` is the safest, but might not be what the system expects if it assumes I *can* determine the piece.\n\nGiven the instructions \"Your goal is to help place pieces optimally to clear lines and avoid stacking too high,\" and \"The primary area needing attention is the entire left side of the board (C0-C2), which is dangerously high and likely contains holes... The completely empty right side (C4-C9) is a significant opportunity...\", the best first step *towards* a strategy, even without knowing the piece, is to attempt to move it away from the high columns and towards the empty ones.\n\nThus, moving `RIGHT` is the most logical \"first step\" of a plan to fill the empty columns on the right, assuming the piece starts somewhere in the middle.\n\nSince I am restricted to one action, and cannot complete a `Placement_Plan` without knowing the piece, I will state that the plan is incomplete.\nIf I put `RIGHT`, it implies a piece is there, and I want to move it right. This is the most reasonable assumption for an optimal play in the absence of precise info on the current piece.\nthought: The primary challenge in this game state is the extreme imbalance of the board, with columns C0-C2 being very high (10, 10, 11) and columns C4-C9 being completely empty (0). Column C3 is at height 3.\n\nA critical piece of information is missing: the identity of the current falling piece. Without knowing the shape and orientation of the active tetromino, it is impossible to formulate a truly \"optimal\" placement plan involving rotations and precise horizontal movements. The provided \"Aggregate Stats\" does not explicitly state the current or next piece type in a discernible format.\n\nHowever, I must provide an action. Given the board's state, the overarching strategic goal should be to level the board by filling the empty right side (C4-C9) and avoiding adding height to the already dangerous left side (C0-C2).\n\nAssuming the active piece spawns in a typical center position (e.g., around columns 3-6), moving it to the right is the most logical initial step towards positioning it over the empty columns. This minimizes the risk of increasing the height on the high left side and initiates a movement towards the advantageous open area.\n\nSince I cannot determine rotations or specific final placements without knowing the piece, a full \"Placement_Plan\" cannot be provided. The immediate action is to move the piece to the right, beginning the process of shifting it to the empty side of the board.\n\nPlacement_Plan: (Unable to formulate a full plan without knowing the current piece. The intention is to move the piece towards the right side of the board to start filling the empty columns.)",

To make a decision, I need to know the *current falling piece*. The provided 'textual_representation' does not explicitly state the active piece or the next piece. However, the 'Aggregate Stats' list includes \"Next Piece Type\". I need to find this.\n\nScanning through the aggregate stats, I see various numbers. Without a mapping for what each number represents in the \"Aggregate Stats\", it's difficult to accurately determine the current piece. The string `Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)` suggests that 'Next Piece Type' is one of the early entries.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is one of the standard tetrominoes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z). Given the empty right side of the board, any piece can potentially be placed there. The goal should be to fill the right side and minimize height, or prepare for a T-spin/tetris if an I-piece is coming.\n\nSince I don't know the current piece, I cannot determine rotations or horizontal movements. This is a critical missing piece of information. The prompt requires me to *plan the optimal next move*, but without knowing *what piece* I'm moving, any plan would be arbitrary.\n\nLet's re-examine the prompt to see if I missed any information that would implicitly define the piece. \"Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\". This describes the *static* part of the board. The 'Aggregate Stats' are also a general summary. \"Visual Analysis (secondary representation from Perception Module): N/A\" also means I can't rely on visual parsing.\n\nGiven this constraint, I have to make a guess or choose a \"safe\" action. The most \"safe\" action when lacking piece information is often `NO_OP`, as it simply lets the piece fall one step, which might reveal its shape in a future observation if the game system provides dynamic updates in that manner. However, this is not an optimal play in a real Tetris game where a piece appears and you have to move it.\n\nIf I *must* choose an action to \"plan the optimal next move\", and I don't know the piece, the task is inherently flawed. I cannot predict an optimal move without knowing what piece I am moving.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of demonstrating the response format, that I *had* a piece, for instance, an 'I' piece.\nIf it were an 'I' piece:\n- Placing it horizontally (rotate_right or rotate_left) in C0-C3 would make the left side even higher (e.g., in C0-C3, it would add 1 to height 11, 12, 12, 3).\n- Placing it vertically in C0 would increase C0 to 15.\n- Placing it horizontally on the right side would be ideal to level the board. It would fill C6-C9, bringing those up to height 1. Or, it could fill C5-C8.\n- To place an I-piece horizontally on the right, it would need to move right several times.\n\nGiven the instructions: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" and \"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice to fit against the wall.\" in the example, it implies I should *know* the current piece. The example implies the piece information *should* be available.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" format is usually `[Holes, Roughness, Aggregate Height, Lines Cleared, Current Piece ID, Next Piece ID, ...]`. If the list starts with a sequence like `[12, 10, 13, 13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, it's possible the piece ID is embedded.\n\nLooking at the problem description for 'Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)', it explicitly says \"Next Piece Type\". It doesn't say \"Current Piece Type\". This is a critical missing piece of information for optimal play.\n\nHowever, if I assume the prompt expects me to deduce the active piece from the \"Aggregate Stats\", that's a complex task without a mapping. The sheer length of the list suggests a detailed board state encoding.\nLet's look at the first few numbers: `[12, 10, 13, 13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\n\nThis looks like multiple feature vectors concatenated. The first few elements `[12, 10, 13]` could be \"holes, roughness, aggregate height\". The next set of numbers is `[13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This looks suspiciously like column heights, but it's not the same as the 'Board Feature Summary' `[11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nWithout a clear definition of the Aggregate Stats, identifying the current piece is impossible.\n\n**Re-reading the problem description and example:**\n\"Current Game State (primary representation): Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\nThis is the static board.\n\"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [....]\" This is a long vector.\n\nThe example response clearly states: \"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\" This implies the model *should* know the current piece. The absence of explicit current piece information in the prompt is a problem.\n\n**Strategy under uncertainty:**\nIf I absolutely must provide a plan and a move without knowing the current piece, the safest generic strategy given the board state is to try and fill the large void on the right. This generally means moving right. If the piece is tall, it might need rotation to become wider to fill the bottom. But without knowing the shape, I cannot even determine if it is 'tall' or 'wide'.\n\nLet's assume the problem implicitly contains the active piece in the \"Aggregate Stats\" somewhere, and I am supposed to infer it. This is a common pattern in some Tetris AI challenges where piece type is numerical (e.g., 0-6 for I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the piece from the given text, and the example *requires* me to know the piece type (\"J-piece\"), I am in a bind. I will *have to assume a piece* or make a meta-decision about the missing information.\n\nGiven the goal to build up the right side (C4-C9) which are all 0, and C3 is at 3, the most common pieces, if placed without rotation, would fall into C4.\n- An I-piece (4 blocks long) would fall into C4-C7.\n- An O-piece (2x2) would fall into C4-C5.\n- A T-piece would fall into C3/C4/C5, or C4/C5/C6 etc.\n- L/J/S/Z pieces are similar.\n\nTo start filling the right side, the immediate action for most pieces would be to move right. This is the most general \"good\" first move for the current board state *if* the piece spawns in the center.\n\nLet's assume the active piece is a standard spawning I-piece (spawns horizontally usually near the center, C3-C6 or C4-C7). If it spawns C3-C6, moving right is necessary to place it further right.\nIf it spawns at C4-C7, then moving right or left could be useful, depending on the desired exact placement.\n\nGiven the extreme imbalance, *any* piece that can fit into C4-C9 is good. Moving it to the right side is a priority.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' piece. If it spawns in the middle (e.g., C3-C6), to place it into the clear right side, it would need to move RIGHT. The full plan would involve moving it right to column C6 (to fill C6-C9). This would be 3-4 RIGHT moves depending on spawn.\n\nLet's assume the piece is a 'J' piece, similar to the example. A J-piece is 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks high at one end (or 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks high when rotated).\nIf a J-piece spawns in the center (e.g., blocks in C3, C4, C5, and one block in C3/C4/C5 one row above), moving it to the right would be beneficial to fill the right side.\nFor a J-piece, its default orientation (if it's the \"7\" shape with the block on the left) would likely occupy 3 columns.\nIf it spawns over C3, C4, C5:\n- It can be moved to C4, C5, C6.\n- Or moved to C5, C6, C7.\n- Or moved to C6, C7, C8.\n- Or moved to C7, C8, C9 (if it's not too wide or rotated).\n\nThe most important immediate action is to move the piece away from the high left side towards the empty right side. Thus, `RIGHT` is the most logical first move.\n\nSince I don't have the piece, I cannot specify rotations. The first step is usually horizontal positioning.\nI will default to moving right, as it's the direction of the empty space. I cannot make a \"full plan\" without knowing the piece and its initial orientation. The prompt demands a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" but this is impossible without current piece information.\n\nI'll have to state this limitation in my thought process. I *cannot* know the optimal full sequence without the piece. I will make a reasonable assumption for the *first* move to address the board imbalance.\n\n**What is the 'next piece type' in the aggregate stats?**\nThe aggregate stats are a long list. It's difficult to parse without a key.\nExample: `[12, 10, 13, 13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nLet's consider if the active piece is actually *part* of the \"Board Feature Summary\" and I need to identify it. No, \"Board Feature Summary\" is heights. The active piece would usually be represented in a 2D grid which is not provided.\n\nGiven the specific instruction \"Placement_Plan: [The full sequence of ideal actions]\", and my inability to determine the active piece, I must acknowledge this. However, I still need to output a single action.\n\nI will assume there is an active piece (otherwise there would be no move to make). Given the board shape, the most generally useful first move for almost *any* piece that starts somewhat centrally is to move it towards the gaping hole on the right. This means moving `RIGHT`. I cannot determine rotations or further horizontal moves without knowing the piece type and initial rotation.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable first step I can definitively say without knowing the piece is to shift it generally towards the target area.\nIf I *had* to guess a piece, a common piece that benefits from moving right to fill a flat well is the I-piece or an O-piece.\n\nLet's assume the active piece is an 'I' piece (often spawns horizontally at the top, typically over C3-C6 or C4-C7).\nTo fill the right side (C4-C9), placing an I-piece horizontally would be ideal.\nIf it spawns over C3-C6, it needs 3 'RIGHT' moves to place it over C6-C9.\nIf it spawns over C4-C7, it needs 2 'RIGHT' moves to place it over C6-C9.\nThe first action in either case would be `RIGHT`.\nThis would be a good start to build up the right side and set up for future line clears.\n\nSince the task specifically asks for *one* chosen action string, and I cannot complete the full plan, I'll provide the first logical step given the severe board imbalance.\nThe board has a very high left side (C0-C2) and an entirely empty right side (C4-C9). The immediate goal is to fill the right side and try to level the board. The default spawn location for most pieces is somewhere in the middle, typically centered. Therefore, the first step for most pieces would be to move to the right to access the empty columns.\nthought: The primary goal is to address the severe imbalance of the board. Columns C0, C1, and C2 are very high (11, 12, 12), while columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). Column C3 is at height 3. The strategy is to move the current falling piece to the right side of the board (columns C4-C9) to begin filling the empty space and level out the board.\n\nA critical piece of information, the identity of the current falling piece, is missing from the provided \"Board Feature Summary\" and \"Aggregate Stats\" textual representation. Without knowing the piece type (e.g., I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) and its current orientation, it is impossible to determine the \"optimal full sequence of ideal actions\" (rotations + horizontal movements).\n\nHowever, I must provide an action. Assuming a standard piece spawn somewhere in the center of the board, the most universally beneficial first action to move *any* piece towards the empty right side of the board is a `RIGHT` move. This initiates the process of positioning the piece in the desired area. I cannot predict subsequent moves (rotations or more horizontal shifts) without knowing the piece. Therefore, I will plan for the first rightward movement.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, [further moves depend on piece type]\nmove: right",

The example implies the piece information *should* be available.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" format is usually `[Holes, Roughness, Aggregate Height, Lines Cleared, Current Piece ID, Next Piece ID, ...]`. If the list starts with a sequence like `[12, 10, 13, 13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, it's possible the piece ID is embedded.\n\nLooking at the problem description for 'Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)', it explicitly says \"Next Piece Type\". It doesn't say \"Current Piece Type\". This is a critical missing piece of information for optimal play.\n\nHowever, if I assume the prompt expects me to deduce the active piece from the \"Aggregate Stats\", that's a complex task without a mapping. The sheer length of the list suggests a detailed board state encoding.\nLet's look at the first few numbers: `[12, 10, 13, 13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\n\nThis looks like multiple feature vectors concatenated. The first few elements `[12, 10, 13]` could be \"holes, roughness, aggregate height\". The next set of numbers is `[13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This looks suspiciously like column heights, but it's not the same as the 'Board Feature Summary' `[11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nWithout a clear definition of the Aggregate Stats, identifying the current piece is impossible.\n\n**Re-reading the problem description and example:**\n\"Current Game State (primary representation): Board Feature Summary: Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\nThis is the static board.\n\"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.): [....]\" This is a long vector.\n\nThe example response clearly states: \"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\" This implies the model *should* know the current piece. The absence of explicit current piece information in the prompt is a problem.\n\n**Strategy under uncertainty:**\nIf I absolutely must provide a plan and a move without knowing the current piece, the safest generic strategy given the board state is to try and fill the large void on the right. This generally means moving right. If the piece is tall, it might need rotation to become wider to fill the bottom. But without knowing the shape, I cannot even determine if it is 'tall' or 'wide'.\n\nLet's assume the problem implicitly contains the active piece in the \"Aggregate Stats\" somewhere, and I am supposed to infer it. This is a common pattern in some Tetris AI challenges where piece type is numerical (e.g., 0-6 for I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the piece from the given text, and the example *requires* me to know the piece type (\"J-piece\"), I am in a bind. I will *have to assume a piece* or make a meta-decision about the missing information.\n\nGiven the goal to build up the right side (C4-C9) which are all 0, and C3 is at 3, the most common pieces, if placed without rotation, would fall into C4.\n- An I-piece (4 blocks long) would fall into C4-C7.\n- An O-piece (2x2) would fall into C4-C5.\n- A T-piece would fall into C3/C4/C5, or C4/C5/C6 etc.\n- L/J/S/Z pieces are similar.\n\nTo start filling the right side, the immediate action for most pieces would be to move right. This is the most general \"good\" first move for the current board state *if* the piece spawns in the center.\n\nLet's assume the active piece is a standard spawning I-piece (spawns horizontally usually near the center, C3-C6 or C4-C7). If it spawns C3-C6, moving right is necessary to place it further right.\nIf it spawns at C4-C7, then moving right or left could be useful, depending on the desired exact placement.\n\nGiven the extreme imbalance, *any* piece that can fit into C4-C9 is good. Moving it to the right side is a priority.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' piece. If it spawns in the middle (e.g., C3-C6), to place it into the clear right side, it would need to move RIGHT. The full plan would involve moving it right to column C6 (to fill C6-C9). This would be 3-4 RIGHT moves depending on spawn.\n\nLet's assume the piece is a 'J' piece, similar to the example. A J-piece is 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks high at one end (or 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks high when rotated).\nIf a J-piece spawns in the center (e.g., blocks in C3, C4, C5, and one block in C3/C4/C5 one row above), moving it to the right would be beneficial to fill the right side.\nFor a J-piece, its default orientation (if it's the \"7\" shape with the block on the left) would likely occupy 3 columns.\nIf it spawns over C3, C4, C5:\n- It can be moved to C4, C5, C6.\n- Or moved to C5, C6, C7.\n- Or moved to C6, C7, C8.\n- Or moved to C7, C8, C9 (if it's not too wide or rotated).\n\nThe most important immediate action is to move the piece away from the high left side towards the empty right side. Thus, `RIGHT` is the most logical first move.\n\nSince I don't have the piece, I cannot specify rotations. The first step is usually horizontal positioning.\nI will default to moving right, as it's the direction of the empty space. I cannot make a \"full plan\" without knowing the piece and its initial orientation. The prompt demands a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" but this is impossible without current piece information.\n\nI'll have to state this limitation in my thought process. I *cannot* know the optimal full sequence without the piece. I will make a reasonable assumption for the *first* move to address the board imbalance.\n\n**What is the 'next piece type' in the aggregate stats?**\nThe aggregate stats are a long list. It's difficult to parse without a key.\nExample: `[12, 10, 13, 13, 12, 10, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 10, 13, 11, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nLet's consider if the active piece is actually *part* of the \"Board Feature Summary\" and I need to identify it. No, \"Board Feature Summary\" is heights. The active piece would usually be represented in a 2D grid which is not provided.\n\nGiven the specific instruction \"Placement_Plan: [The full sequence of ideal actions]\", and my inability to determine the active piece, I must acknowledge this. However, I still need to output a single action.\n\nI will assume there is an active piece (otherwise there would be no move to make). Given the board shape, the most generally useful first move for almost *any* piece that starts somewhat centrally is to move it towards the gaping hole on the right. This means moving `RIGHT`. I cannot determine rotations or further horizontal moves without knowing the piece type and initial rotation.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable first step I can definitively say without knowing the piece is to shift it generally towards the target area.\nIf I *had* to guess a piece, a common piece that benefits from moving right to fill a flat well is the I-piece or an O-piece.\n\nLet's assume the active piece is an 'I' piece (often spawns horizontally at the top, typically over C3-C6 or C4-C7).\nTo fill the right side (C4-C9), placing an I-piece horizontally would be ideal.\nIf it spawns over C3-C6, it needs 3 'RIGHT' moves to place it over C6-C9.\nIf it spawns over C4-C7, it needs 2 'RIGHT' moves to place it over C6-C9.\nThe first action in either case would be `RIGHT`.\nThis would be a good start to build up the right side and set up for future line clears.\n\nSince the task specifically asks for *one* chosen action string, and I cannot complete the full plan, I'll provide the first logical step given the severe board imbalance.\nThe board has a very high left side (C0-C2) and an entirely empty right side (C4-C9). The immediate goal is to fill the right side and try to level the board. The default spawn location for most pieces is somewhere in the middle, typically centered. Therefore, the first step for most pieces would be to move to the right to access the empty columns.\nthought: The primary goal is to address the severe imbalance of the board. Columns C0, C1, and C2 are very high (11, 12, 12), while columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). Column C3 is at height 3. The strategy is to move the current falling piece to the right side of the board (columns C4-C9) to begin filling the empty space and level out the board.\n\nA critical piece of information, the identity of the current falling piece, is missing from the provided \"Board Feature Summary\" and \"Aggregate Stats\" textual representation. Without knowing the piece type (e.g., I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) and its current orientation, it is impossible to determine the \"optimal full sequence of ideal actions\" (rotations + horizontal movements).\n\nHowever, I must provide an action. Assuming a standard piece spawn somewhere in the center of the board, the most universally beneficial first action to move *any* piece towards the empty right side of the board is a `RIGHT` move. This initiates the process of positioning the piece in the desired area. I cannot predict subsequent moves (rotations or more horizontal shifts) without knowing the piece. Therefore, I will plan for the first rightward movement.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, [further moves depend on piece type]",

    "response": "thought: The current game state shows a very uneven board. Columns C0-C3 are high (13-15), while C4-C9 are completely empty. This presents an opportunity to create a deep well on the right side for Tetrises, but first, we need to deal with the active piece.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long vector, but the critical part is the initial `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nLet's deduce the active piece from the changes in the aggregate stats, or rather, from a common understanding of Tetris game states when only this feature vector is given. Since no active piece type or its current position is explicitly given, I must infer. The standard assumption in such scenarios, when only the \"Column Heights Vector\" is provided, is that the active piece has already impacted the board or is not explicitly described in its falling state, and the task is to describe the next 'ideal' *placement* given a *next piece type*. However, the prompt also gives \"Available Actions: NO_OP, LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP\". This implies there *is* an active piece that I need to manipulate.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" portion of the input contains many numbers. It usually represents various board features and *might* contain information about the current piece or next piece. Without a clear legend for these numbers, it's hard to interpret beyond the explicit \"Column Heights Vector\". Let's assume the first few numbers after the column heights are related to the active piece, or that the active piece is implicitly to be inferred from a visual representation (which is N/A here) or a structured textual description (which is also N/A beyond the column heights).\n\nGiven the lack of explicit active piece information in the primary representation, and the absence of a visual analysis or a `processed_visual_description`, I cannot accurately identify the active piece type or its current spawning position. This makes it impossible to plan specific rotations or horizontal movements.\n\nHowever, the problem statement provides examples where the active piece is known (e.g., \"T-piece\", \"J-piece\"). I need to infer. The \"Aggregate Stats\" list is very long. Let me look for patterns or common ways this might encode `Next Piece Type`. Often, a single digit or a specific range of numbers might indicate the piece type. Unfortunately, without a legend, this is impossible to interpret reliably.\n\nSince I cannot know the active piece, I must make a default move or acknowledge this limitation. If forced to choose an action, and assuming a default spawning position (usually top-middle) and a generic piece, the most common immediate action in a heavily uneven board like this is often to adjust horizontally or rotate.\n\nGiven `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is extremely lopsided. The left side is very high and needs to be cleared, while the right side is completely empty.\n\nIf I had to guess the most strategic general action without knowing the piece:\n*   **Avoid immediate HARD_DROP:** Without knowing the piece, dropping it randomly could create more holes or stack higher.\n*   **Rotation:** Essential for placing many pieces, but useless without knowing the piece type.\n*   **Movement (LEFT/RIGHT):** This is for positioning.\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the active piece, I cannot determine an optimal \"Placement_Plan\". I'm in a tricky situation where critical information is missing.\n\nLet's re-read: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" \"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\" \"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\" This implies that the piece *is* known, but the input format does not provide it.\n\nIf the \"Aggregate Stats\" vector is meant to implicitly contain the next piece, without a key, it's unreadable.\nExample of \"Aggregate Stats\" from the prompt: `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 21, 16, 14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nThis seems to contain multiple sets of \"column heights\" or similar features. The prompt itself specifies `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` as the *primary representation*. The Aggregate Stats are listed *after* that.\n\nGiven the primary representation **only** describes the board height, and nothing about the active piece, I am operating under extreme uncertainty.\nHowever, I *must* output a `move`.\n\nLet's assume the question implies I should be able to infer the active piece *somehow* from the `Aggregate Stats`. This is highly problematic without context.\n\nIf I consider the example responses:\n\"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\"\n\"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\"\n\nThese suggest that the piece type *should* be available to me. The most likely source is within the `Aggregate Stats`. Let's assume it's one of the common pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L).\n\nGiven the board: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nA well is formed at C4-C9. A deep well is desirable.\nThe left side is very high. It seems like the goal is to clear lines there. A single line clear on row 13 would be significant.\nA T-piece or L-piece could potentially fill column 3 and some of C0-C2. An I-piece could clear a line.\n\nSince I am unable to determine the current falling piece, making an optimal plan is impossible. I cannot choose between `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT` without knowing the piece's shape and its current orientation and position.\n\nThe prompt states: \"Your task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\" and \"Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\"\nMy `processed_visual_description` is N/A. My `textual_representation` for the board state is `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. It does *not* specify the active piece.\n\nThis is a critical gap in information. I cannot proceed with an \"optimal\" plan.\nWhat should I do in this situation? I am forced to output a `move`.\nA `NO_OP` would mean doing nothing, which is almost never optimal in Tetris.\nAny `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `ROTATE` action would be arbitrary without the piece information.\n\nLet's try to interpret the \"Aggregate Stats\" again, just in case there's an implicit encoding. These vectors are often used to represent many features like `holes`, `roughness`, `cleared lines`, `piece count`, etc. The repetition of patterns like `15, 21, 16` and various heights suggests different board states or projections. The prompt explicitly says `Next Piece Type` is part of these stats, but doesn't tell me *where* it is or *how* it's encoded.\n\nIf I *must* make a move and cannot infer the piece, I will state this limitation. However, the system expects a concrete action.\nLet's consider the most *general* useful thing to do if the board has a huge gap like C4-C9. Often, we want to move pieces towards the empty side to start filling it, or to rotate to fit into existing crevices. But with columns C0-C3 so high, a piece might be constrained on the left.\n\nThe board shape is highly asymmetrical.\n`[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe highest point is 15 at C1 and C2. The goal is to clear lines, especially to reduce C1, C2.\nA common strategy is to try to create a flat surface or a single-column well. Here, there's a natural well on the far right.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, the best I can do is make an educated guess about a common starting strategy. For a very high left side and an empty right side, the general goal would be to move pieces right to start filling the void or to rotate them to create flat surfaces on the left.\nGiven the large gap, a common strategy would be to move pieces right.\nThe height difference is 13 (C3) to 0 (C4). This gap is significant.\n\nIf the piece spawns in the middle (e.g., C3-C6 for a 4-wide piece, or C4-C5 for a 2-wide piece), moving it right would be a general default action to push it towards the empty side.\n\nLet's assume a generic piece spawns in the center, say around columns 3-6.\nThe board needs flattening on the left. If a piece can fit into column 3 to flatten it with C0, C1, C2, that would be good.\nOr if it can be placed to clear a line, that's better.\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot determine the active piece. Therefore, I cannot provide an *optimal* plan. I will have to pick a default action.\nA `RIGHT` move is often a safe initial move to get a piece out of the center spawn and towards one side, especially if there's a large empty area. In this case, the right side is entirely empty.\n\nHowever, moving right might drop a piece into column 4, making it 1 unit high, which is 13 units below column 3. This isn't necessarily bad if it's the start of building a foundation.\n\nSince I *must* provide a \"Placement_Plan\" and a \"move\", and I have no information on the active piece, I will explicitly state this assumption. I cannot deduce it from the provided text.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is an 'I' tetromino, as it's often the most versatile for clearing lines or spanning gaps. If it's an 'I' piece, spawned horizontally, it would occupy 4 columns. Spawned vertically, 1 column, 4 rows.\nIf it spawns at C3-C6 (horizontal I-piece), and the goal is to fill the right side, a `RIGHT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to vertical) would be useful.\nIf it's spawned vertically at C4, it would be [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] as heights. This is not beneficial.\n\nThe situation is that I *cannot* know the piece. I cannot formulate an optimal plan. I need to output *something*.\nIn the absence of a piece, I'll assume the goal is to set up a well. To do that, pieces typically move right.\nLet me make a very basic assumption: if no piece type is given, a `RIGHT` move is a generic exploration/positioning move.\n\nI *need* to state the missing information.\n\"Without explicit identification of the active falling piece (e.g., from `processed_visual_description` or `Aggregate Stats` details), an optimal placement plan cannot be determined.\"\nHowever, the prompt also says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" This suggests that the piece *is* implicitly defined.\n\nWhat if the first number of the `Aggregate Stats` *is* the piece type? `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`. If 15 is a piece ID, what does it map to? Unlikely.\n\nThe problem implies the information exists, and I'm failing to parse it. This is a common challenge in these types of text-based games. The \"Aggregate Stats\" usually contains features, not the direct piece type unless explicitly stated.\n\nLet me try a different angle. The *example* response for \"J-piece needs to be moved left twice\" and \"T-piece needs to be rotated right\" implies that the piece type *is* known at the time of planning. Since my current input explicitly lacks this, I will state that the best I can do is a generic action based on the board shape, assuming a standard piece spawn.\n\nGiven the board: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe critical issue is the empty space on the right (C4-C9) and the high left side (C0-C3).\nTo clear lines on the left, we need pieces to fill those gaps. To prepare for a Tetris on the right, we usually build up columns C4-C8 and leave C9 open, or vice-versa.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, I cannot determine the exact strategy for line clearing or well building.\nI will have to make a very generalized move. A `RIGHT` move is a common first action if a piece spawns centrally and needs to go to the right, which is the \"open\" part of this board.\n\nThis is a scenario where the prompt implicitly expects information that is not explicitly provided in the `textual_representation`.\nI cannot construct a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" without knowing the piece.\nTherefore, I will create a plan that focuses on a generic initial step, making an assumption about the piece's initial position.\n\nAssumption: A piece has spawned centrally and needs to be moved towards the empty right side.\n\nPlan: Move the piece right to start filling the gap or to prepare for a rotation into the main well area. The specific number of `RIGHT` moves or `ROTATIONS` is impossible to determine without the piece type. Thus, the first move is `RIGHT`.\n\nIf the piece starts at columns 3-6 (common for 4-wide pieces) or 4-5 (common for 2-3 wide pieces), a single `RIGHT` move would shift it away from the highest stack on the left and towards the empty area.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' piece. If it spawns horizontally in columns 3-6, and the goal is to drop it down to clear the line at height 13 (C3), it would need to move `LEFT` to C0-C3, or `RIGHT` to C6-C9.\nThe C0-C3 section is very uneven.\n\nThis is very speculative. I need to make a decision. I will explicitly state the lack of piece information.\nGiven the critical information (active piece type and initial orientation/position) is missing, I cannot formulate an *optimal* plan. However, I must output an action. I will choose a 'RIGHT' move as a general attempt to shift any piece towards the empty part of the board, as a common initial step for dealing with a lopsided board. This move, without piece info, is speculative.\nIf I'm forced to generate a `Placement_Plan`, it would be `RIGHT, HARD_DROP` as a placeholder, acknowledging its suboptimality.\n\nThe instruction states: \"The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\"\nThis means I must have a `Placement_Plan`.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an L-piece, spawns in a typical orientation.\nL-piece (standard rotation 0):\nXXX\nX\n(spawns roughly 4th/5th column)\n\nBoard: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nA hole exists at `C3` if we build `C0, C1, C2` to `15`. A `HARD_DROP` in the middle would be detrimental.\n\nThis is a fundamental flaw in the input if the piece is not provided. I'll make a highly speculative plan based on a common scenario.\nOften, the very first action needed is a rotation if the piece is in the wrong orientation, or a lateral move.\n\nLet me default to a `RIGHT` move as a generic action for moving a piece towards the open field on the right. This is a common initial step when the left side is cluttered and the right side is open. It's a move to reposition rather than to place.\n\nFinal thought before execution: The key challenge is the missing active piece type. Without it, *any* specific placement or rotation is a guess. The board suggests moving pieces to the right to start building, or rotating to fit existing gaps/clear lines on the left. Since the left side is very high, moving right to create a cleaner setup on the empty side might be a safer general strategy for the first move, assuming a piece spawns centrally.\nI will assume an 'I' piece as it's fundamental. If an 'I' piece spawns horizontally (4 cells wide), moving it right could position it over C4-C7. If it spawns vertically (1 cell wide), moving it right could position it over C4.\nLet's assume a generic piece needs to be moved `RIGHT` to begin navigating the empty space, without any specific rotation.\nThe `Placement_Plan` would be a sequence of `RIGHT` moves followed by `HARD_DROP` if the piece is to be dropped on the right.\nGiven the current highly uneven board, a `RIGHT` move could be the start of filling the void on the right.\nI cannot make a detailed plan without knowing the piece.\nI'll select `RIGHT`.\nthought: The provided game state only includes the column heights `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and various aggregate stats, but crucially, it does not explicitly state the type, orientation, or current position of the active falling piece. This missing information makes it impossible to formulate an *optimal* and precise placement plan.\n\nHowever, I am required to provide a `Placement_Plan` and an immediate `move`. Given the highly unbalanced board, with columns C0-C3 being high and columns C4-C9 being completely empty, a common strategic initial move is to direct the falling piece towards the empty side of the board. This allows for building a stable foundation on the right, potentially for a Tetris well, or simply to get the piece out of the way of the high stacks on the left.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, I will make a generic assumption that the piece spawns in a central-top location (e.g., around columns 3-6) and that a `RIGHT` movement is a reasonable first step to begin positioning it over the empty columns. This is a general exploratory move rather than a targeted optimal placement. Any rotation or specific horizontal move would be pure guesswork without piece information.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, hard_drop (This is a speculative plan assuming a generic piece needs to be moved to the far right, e.g., to column 7-9 depending on its shape, before a hard drop. The number of 'right' moves is a guess. The actual optimal plan would depend entirely on the piece.)\nmove: right",
    "thought": "The current game state shows a very uneven board. Columns C0-C3 are high (13-15), while C4-C9 are completely empty. This presents an opportunity to create a deep well on the right side for Tetrises, but first, we need to deal with the active piece.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long vector, but the critical part is the initial `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nLet's deduce the active piece from the changes in the aggregate stats, or rather, from a common understanding of Tetris game states when only this feature vector is given. Since no active piece type or its current position is explicitly given, I must infer. The standard assumption in such scenarios, when only the \"Column Heights Vector\" is provided, is that the active piece has already impacted the board or is not explicitly described in its falling state, and the task is to describe the next 'ideal' *placement* given a *next piece type*. However, the prompt also gives \"Available Actions: NO_OP, LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP\". This implies there *is* an active piece that I need to manipulate.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" portion of the input contains many numbers. It usually represents various board features and *might* contain information about the current piece or next piece. Without a clear legend for these numbers, it's hard to interpret beyond the explicit \"Column Heights Vector\". Let's assume the first few numbers after the column heights are related to the active piece, or that the active piece is implicitly to be inferred from a visual representation (which is N/A here) or a structured textual description (which is also N/A beyond the column heights).\n\nGiven the lack of explicit active piece information in the primary representation, and the absence of a visual analysis or a `processed_visual_description`, I cannot accurately identify the active piece type or its current spawning position. This makes it impossible to plan specific rotations or horizontal movements.\n\nHowever, the problem statement provides examples where the active piece is known (e.g., \"T-piece\", \"J-piece\"). I need to infer. The \"Aggregate Stats\" list is very long. Let me look for patterns or common ways this might encode `Next Piece Type`. Often, a single digit or a specific range of numbers might indicate the piece type. Unfortunately, without a legend, this is impossible to interpret reliably.\n\nSince I cannot know the active piece, I must make a default move or acknowledge this limitation. If forced to choose an action, and assuming a default spawning position (usually top-middle) and a generic piece, the most common immediate action in a heavily uneven board like this is often to adjust horizontally or rotate.\n\nGiven `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is extremely lopsided. The left side is very high and needs to be cleared, while the right side is completely empty.\n\nIf I had to guess the most strategic general action without knowing the piece:\n*   **Avoid immediate HARD_DROP:** Without knowing the piece, dropping it randomly could create more holes or stack higher.\n*   **Rotation:** Essential for placing many pieces, but useless without knowing the piece type.\n*   **Movement (LEFT/RIGHT):** This is for positioning.\n\nSince I cannot definitively identify the active piece, I cannot determine an optimal \"Placement_Plan\". I'm in a tricky situation where critical information is missing.\n\nLet's re-read: \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" \"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\" \"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\" This implies that the piece *is* known, but the input format does not provide it.\n\nIf the \"Aggregate Stats\" vector is meant to implicitly contain the next piece, without a key, it's unreadable.\nExample of \"Aggregate Stats\" from the prompt: `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 21, 16, 14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`\nThis seems to contain multiple sets of \"column heights\" or similar features. The prompt itself specifies `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` as the *primary representation*. The Aggregate Stats are listed *after* that.\n\nGiven the primary representation **only** describes the board height, and nothing about the active piece, I am operating under extreme uncertainty.\nHowever, I *must* output a `move`.\n\nLet's assume the question implies I should be able to infer the active piece *somehow* from the `Aggregate Stats`. This is highly problematic without context.\n\nIf I consider the example responses:\n\"The current J-piece needs to be moved left twice...\"\n\"The current T-piece needs to be rotated right...\"\n\nThese suggest that the piece type *should* be available to me. The most likely source is within the `Aggregate Stats`. Let's assume it's one of the common pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L).\n\nGiven the board: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nA well is formed at C4-C9. A deep well is desirable.\nThe left side is very high. It seems like the goal is to clear lines there. A single line clear on row 13 would be significant.\nA T-piece or L-piece could potentially fill column 3 and some of C0-C2. An I-piece could clear a line.\n\nSince I am unable to determine the current falling piece, making an optimal plan is impossible. I cannot choose between `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, `ROTATE_RIGHT` without knowing the piece's shape and its current orientation and position.\n\nThe prompt states: \"Your task is to select the best moves for the current piece and board state.\" and \"Carefully analyze the information from `processed_visual_description` and/or `textual_representation`.\"\nMy `processed_visual_description` is N/A. My `textual_representation` for the board state is `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. It does *not* specify the active piece.\n\nThis is a critical gap in information. I cannot proceed with an \"optimal\" plan.\nWhat should I do in this situation? I am forced to output a `move`.\nA `NO_OP` would mean doing nothing, which is almost never optimal in Tetris.\nAny `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `ROTATE` action would be arbitrary without the piece information.\n\nLet's try to interpret the \"Aggregate Stats\" again, just in case there's an implicit encoding. These vectors are often used to represent many features like `holes`, `roughness`, `cleared lines`, `piece count`, etc. The repetition of patterns like `15, 21, 16` and various heights suggests different board states or projections. The prompt explicitly says `Next Piece Type` is part of these stats, but doesn't tell me *where* it is or *how* it's encoded.\n\nIf I *must* make a move and cannot infer the piece, I will state this limitation. However, the system expects a concrete action.\nLet's consider the most *general* useful thing to do if the board has a huge gap like C4-C9. Often, we want to move pieces towards the empty side to start filling it, or to rotate to fit into existing crevices. But with columns C0-C3 so high, a piece might be constrained on the left.\n\nThe board shape is highly asymmetrical.\n`[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe highest point is 15 at C1 and C2. The goal is to clear lines, especially to reduce C1, C2.\nA common strategy is to try to create a flat surface or a single-column well. Here, there's a natural well on the far right.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, the best I can do is make an educated guess about a common starting strategy. For a very high left side and an empty right side, the general goal would be to move pieces right to start filling the void or to rotate them to create flat surfaces on the left.\nGiven the large gap, a common strategy would be to move pieces right.\nThe height difference is 13 (C3) to 0 (C4). This gap is significant.\n\nIf the piece spawns in the middle (e.g., C3-C6 for a 4-wide piece, or C4-C5 for a 2-wide piece), moving it right would be a general default action to push it towards the empty side.\n\nLet's assume a generic piece spawns in the center, say around columns 3-6.\nThe board needs flattening on the left. If a piece can fit into column 3 to flatten it with C0, C1, C2, that would be good.\nOr if it can be placed to clear a line, that's better.\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot determine the active piece. Therefore, I cannot provide an *optimal* plan. I will have to pick a default action.\nA `RIGHT` move is often a safe initial move to get a piece out of the center spawn and towards one side, especially if there's a large empty area. In this case, the right side is entirely empty.\n\nHowever, moving right might drop a piece into column 4, making it 1 unit high, which is 13 units below column 3. This isn't necessarily bad if it's the start of building a foundation.\n\nSince I *must* provide a \"Placement_Plan\" and a \"move\", and I have no information on the active piece, I will explicitly state this assumption. I cannot deduce it from the provided text.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is an 'I' tetromino, as it's often the most versatile for clearing lines or spanning gaps. If it's an 'I' piece, spawned horizontally, it would occupy 4 columns. Spawned vertically, 1 column, 4 rows.\nIf it spawns at C3-C6 (horizontal I-piece), and the goal is to fill the right side, a `RIGHT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to vertical) would be useful.\nIf it's spawned vertically at C4, it would be [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] as heights. This is not beneficial.\n\nThe situation is that I *cannot* know the piece. I cannot formulate an optimal plan. I need to output *something*.\nIn the absence of a piece, I'll assume the goal is to set up a well. To do that, pieces typically move right.\nLet me make a very basic assumption: if no piece type is given, a `RIGHT` move is a generic exploration/positioning move.\n\nI *need* to state the missing information.\n\"Without explicit identification of the active falling piece (e.g., from `processed_visual_description` or `Aggregate Stats` details), an optimal placement plan cannot be determined.\"\nHowever, the prompt also says \"Analyze this Tetris game state and plan the optimal next move.\" This suggests that the piece *is* implicitly defined.\n\nWhat if the first number of the `Aggregate Stats` *is* the piece type? `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`. If 15 is a piece ID, what does it map to? Unlikely.\n\nThe problem implies the information exists, and I'm failing to parse it. This is a common challenge in these types of text-based games. The \"Aggregate Stats\" usually contains features, not the direct piece type unless explicitly stated.\n\nLet me try a different angle. The *example* response for \"J-piece needs to be moved left twice\" and \"T-piece needs to be rotated right\" implies that the piece type *is* known at the time of planning. Since my current input explicitly lacks this, I will state that the best I can do is a generic action based on the board shape, assuming a standard piece spawn.\n\nGiven the board: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThe critical issue is the empty space on the right (C4-C9) and the high left side (C0-C3).\nTo clear lines on the left, we need pieces to fill those gaps. To prepare for a Tetris on the right, we usually build up columns C4-C8 and leave C9 open, or vice-versa.\n\nWithout knowing the piece, I cannot determine the exact strategy for line clearing or well building.\nI will have to make a very generalized move. A `RIGHT` move is a common first action if a piece spawns centrally and needs to go to the right, which is the \"open\" part of this board.\n\nThis is a scenario where the prompt implicitly expects information that is not explicitly provided in the `textual_representation`.\nI cannot construct a \"full sequence of ideal actions\" without knowing the piece.\nTherefore, I will create a plan that focuses on a generic initial step, making an assumption about the piece's initial position.\n\nAssumption: A piece has spawned centrally and needs to be moved towards the empty right side.\n\nPlan: Move the piece right to start filling the gap or to prepare for a rotation into the main well area. The specific number of `RIGHT` moves or `ROTATIONS` is impossible to determine without the piece type. Thus, the first move is `RIGHT`.\n\nIf the piece starts at columns 3-6 (common for 4-wide pieces) or 4-5 (common for 2-3 wide pieces), a single `RIGHT` move would shift it away from the highest stack on the left and towards the empty area.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an 'I' piece. If it spawns horizontally in columns 3-6, and the goal is to drop it down to clear the line at height 13 (C3), it would need to move `LEFT` to C0-C3, or `RIGHT` to C6-C9.\nThe C0-C3 section is very uneven.\n\nThis is very speculative. I need to make a decision. I will explicitly state the lack of piece information.\nGiven the critical information (active piece type and initial orientation/position) is missing, I cannot formulate an *optimal* plan. However, I must output an action. I will choose a 'RIGHT' move as a general attempt to shift any piece towards the empty part of the board, as a common initial step for dealing with a lopsided board. This move, without piece info, is speculative.\nIf I'm forced to generate a `Placement_Plan`, it would be `RIGHT, HARD_DROP` as a placeholder, acknowledging its suboptimality.\n\nThe instruction states: \"The action you select for 'move' MUST be the **first unexecuted action** from your 'Placement_Plan'.\"\nThis means I must have a `Placement_Plan`.\n\nLet's assume the piece is an L-piece, spawns in a typical orientation.\nL-piece (standard rotation 0):\nXXX\nX\n(spawns roughly 4th/5th column)\n\nBoard: `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nA hole exists at `C3` if we build `C0, C1, C2` to `15`. A `HARD_DROP` in the middle would be detrimental.\n\nThis is a fundamental flaw in the input if the piece is not provided. I'll make a highly speculative plan based on a common scenario.\nOften, the very first action needed is a rotation if the piece is in the wrong orientation, or a lateral move.\n\nLet me default to a `RIGHT` move as a generic action for moving a piece towards the open field on the right. This is a common initial step when the left side is cluttered and the right side is open. It's a move to reposition rather than to place.\n\nFinal thought before execution: The key challenge is the missing active piece type. Without it, *any* specific placement or rotation is a guess. The board suggests moving pieces to the right to start building, or rotating to fit existing gaps/clear lines on the left. Since the left side is very high, moving right to create a cleaner setup on the empty side might be a safer general strategy for the first move, assuming a piece spawns centrally.\nI will assume an 'I' piece as it's fundamental. If an 'I' piece spawns horizontally (4 cells wide), moving it right could position it over C4-C7. If it spawns vertically (1 cell wide), moving it right could position it over C4.\nLet's assume a generic piece needs to be moved `RIGHT` to begin navigating the empty space, without any specific rotation.\nThe `Placement_Plan` would be a sequence of `RIGHT` moves followed by `HARD_DROP` if the piece is to be dropped on the right.\nGiven the current highly uneven board, a `RIGHT` move could be the start of filling the void on the right.\nI cannot make a detailed plan without knowing the piece.\nI'll select `RIGHT`.\nthought: The provided game state only includes the column heights `[14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and various aggregate stats, but crucially, it does not explicitly state the type, orientation, or current position of the active falling piece. This missing information makes it impossible to formulate an *optimal* and precise placement plan.\n\nHowever, I am required to provide a `Placement_Plan` and an immediate `move`. Given the highly unbalanced board, with columns C0-C3 being high and columns C4-C9 being completely empty, a common strategic initial move is to direct the falling piece towards the empty side of the board. This allows for building a stable foundation on the right, potentially for a Tetris well, or simply to get the piece out of the way of the high stacks on the left.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, I will make a generic assumption that the piece spawns in a central-top location (e.g., around columns 3-6) and that a `RIGHT` movement is a reasonable first step to begin positioning it over the empty columns. This is a general exploratory move rather than a targeted optimal placement. Any rotation or specific horizontal move would be pure guesswork without piece information.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, hard_drop (This is a speculative plan assuming a generic piece needs to be moved to the far right, e.g., to column 7-9 depending on its shape, before a hard drop. The number of 'right' moves is a guess. The actual optimal plan would depend entirely on the piece.)",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate changes from prior states. The current board state shows an extreme imbalance.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without knowledge of the last move or previous thought processes, its effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The left side of the board (Columns 0, 1, and 2) is critically high at heights of 19, 19, and 18 respectively. This is one step away from game over in those columns. Immediate and urgent attention is required here to clear lines. The rest of the board (Columns 4-9) is completely empty, forming a massive well, with Column 3 at a moderate height of 13.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The board is in a precarious state. The primary strategic objective is survival.\n    *   **Immediate Priority:** Focus all efforts on clearing lines from Columns 0-2 to reduce their dangerous height. Any piece that does not contribute to a line clear on the left is extremely risky and could lead to a game over.\n    *   **Utilize the Well (Secondary):** Once the immediate threat on the left is managed, the large empty well on the right (Columns 4-9) presents an excellent opportunity to set up for multiple Tetris clears with I-blocks. However, this is a secondary concern given the current critical heights on the left.\n    *   **Balance:** The board's extreme imbalance must be addressed, but line clears on the left take precedence over building up the right side at this moment.\n\nGiven the dire situation on the left, a \"HARD_DROP\" that clears a line on the left would be ideal, or a \"SOFT_DROP\" followed by a line clear. The specific action depends entirely on the next piece type, which is not provided.",

The prompt states \"identify the current board layout, the active falling piece, its shape, and upcoming pieces\" from the available information, but this information is absent. The \"Aggregate Stats\" is a long, undifferentiated list of numbers, and without a schema, it's impossible to deduce the active piece type or its current position from it.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, its shape, or its current orientation and spawn position, it is impossible to formulate an optimal \"Placement_Plan\" or even an informed next \"move\". Any move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT, SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) would be a blind guess and highly likely to lead to a worse state or immediate game over given the precarious board.\n\nSince I am required to provide a `move` action, and I cannot logically determine an optimal action without the piece information, I will choose `NO_OP`. This action simply lets the piece fall by one row, effectively passing the turn without committing to any horizontal movement or rotation. While not strategic, it is the least committal action when playing completely blind, allowing for a potential re-evaluation if the piece becomes visible or if this action somehow reveals more information in the next turn (though this is unlikely given the current input format).

    "reflection": "The board is in a very early or near-cleared state, with minimal height on the left (C0: 2, C1: 1, C2: 1) and columns C3-C9 completely empty. Without previous context, the effectiveness of past moves cannot be assessed.\n\n**Areas needing attention:**\nThe current low heights on C0-C2 should be integrated into a broader, flat base. The extensive empty space on the right side of the board (C3-C9) presents a significant opportunity.\n\n**Strategic insights:**\nPrioritize building a wide, flat foundation across the entire board. Utilize the empty right side to extend the base without creating significant holes. The goal is to maximize future placement options and prepare for efficient line clears.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven the very open board, a `NO_OP` or `RIGHT` move might be evaluated depending on the incoming piece, but without a next piece, a specific action is hard to recommend. Let's provide a general action that keeps the game moving or allows for more reflection. `NO_OP` is usually a safe bet if no immediate placement is obvious or if time is needed, but typically, we are always dropping. Given the simple state, a `SOFT_DROP` is generally useful for quickly placing pieces.\n\nSince I am asked to provide *one* action, and I don't know the next piece, a neutral move is best, or one that prepares for the incoming piece. If the objective is to *reflect*, the action should logically follow the reflection. My reflection focuses on building a *flat* base. Often, the first piece should just get down quickly to start that base.\n\nLet's assume the current piece is falling, and `SOFT_DROP` will accelerate that.\n\nSOFT_DROP",
    "response": "thought: I have received the board state (Column Heights Vector) but no information about the current falling piece or any upcoming pieces. Without knowing the active piece, its shape, and its initial orientation, it is impossible to formulate an optimal \"Placement_Plan\" involving rotations or specific horizontal movements. The board is largely empty on the right side.\n\nIn the absence of piece information, the most neutral and generally safe action is to `SOFT_DROP`. This allows the piece to fall one row, advancing the game state without making any potentially incorrect rotational or horizontal adjustments. A `HARD_DROP` would be too committal. `NO_OP` would simply stall for a single frame, which is less productive than a soft drop. Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` or `ROTATING` would be pure guesswork. Therefore, `SOFT_DROP` is the best choice to move the game forward given the lack of information.\nPlacement_Plan: SOFT_DROP\nmove: SOFT_DROP",
