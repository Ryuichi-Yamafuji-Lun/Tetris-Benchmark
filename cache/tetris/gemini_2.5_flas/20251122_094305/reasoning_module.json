The board is largely clear, with minimal blocks on the far left (columns C0-C2 heights [2, 1, 1]). The remaining seven columns (C3-C9) are completely empty, indicating either a fresh start or a very successful recent clear.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot assess the effectiveness of the last move or thought process without previous context.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The main area of current interest is the extensive flat space on the right side of the board (C3-C9). The left-side blocks (C0-C2) are minimal and can be integrated into a flat base without immediate concern.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active **I-Line** is currently available. Given the largely empty board with a long, flat stretch to the right, the most strategic play is to rotate the I-Line horizontally and place it at the lowest possible level across the empty columns (e.g., C3-C6, C4-C7, C5-C8, or C6-C9). This action will efficiently maintain a very low and flat board profile, which is crucial for long-term survival and setting up future line clears. Avoid creating any holes or unevenness if possible.",

Dropping it as is would fill columns 3-6 to height 1, creating a very flat and low base for subsequent pieces: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].

For now, focus on establishing a stable base.",
    "response": "thought: The board has a flat block of height 3 in columns 0-3 and is completely empty from columns 4-9. The active piece is a Z-piece.\n\nThe Z-piece can be placed in a few ways:\n1.  **Default orientation (horizontal Z):** This occupies 2x2 space.\n    *   If placed starting in column 2: `[3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0,0,0]` This would create an awkward 4-height block in C2, C3, and C4, C5 while leaving a height of 3 in C0, C1. It would also create a hole at the bottom of C3 or C2 if placed adjacent to the existing wall.\n    *   If placed starting in column 3: `[3,3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0,0]` This would sit on top of the C3 block, pushing C3 to height 4, and building C4, C5 to height 1 (if placed on row 0) or higher. This is still awkward.\n    *   **Best option for default orientation:** Place it in the empty area on the right, for example, starting at column 4. `[3,3,3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0]` This would mean C4 and C5 would be at height 1 (or 0, if it lands on the very bottom). This is a good way to start building the right side.\n\n2.  **Rotated orientation (vertical Z):** This occupies 2x3 space (or 3x2, depending on how you visualize it).\n    *   If rotated right once, it looks like a vertical stack. `[_,Z][Z,_][_,Z]`. When placed, it would typically cover 2 columns.\n    *   `[Z,_,Z,_]`\n    *   `[_,Z,_,Z]` (or vice versa)\n    *   If rotated right (or left) once, the Z-piece takes the shape:\n        `X `\n        `XX`\n        ` X`\n    *   Placing this rotated piece on the far right (e.g., in columns 7-8 or 8-9) would also be a good way to build the right side, without touching the existing wall.\n\nConsidering the immediate goal of creating a stable base and avoiding holes, placing the Z-piece entirely within the empty columns (4-9) is the most favorable strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate the standard orientation (no rotation) and moving it to the right:\n*   **Move Right 1x:** Piece would be in columns (3,4,5,6). It would land on the top of C3, building C3 to height 4, and placing blocks in C4, C5. This is okay, but not ideal as it would create a 4-height block and extend the current flat 3-height surface.\n*   **Move Right 2x:** Piece would be in columns (4,5,6,7). This means it would land entirely on the empty columns. The Z-piece blocks would occupy (col 4, row 0), (col 5, row 0), (col 5, row 1), (col 6, row 1). This would make C4 height 1, C5 height 2, C6 height 2. This is a clean start to building the right side.\n*   **Move Right 3x:** Piece would be in columns (5,6,7,8). This would make C5 height 1, C6 height 2, C7 height 2. Also a clean start.\n*   **Move Right 4x:** Piece would be in columns (6,7,8,9). This would make C6 height 1, C7 height 2, C8 height 2. Also a clean start.\n\nNow let's consider rotating. A Z-piece rotated 90 degrees looks like:\n```\n  X\n XX\n X\n```\nOr, if you see it as occupying 2 columns and 3 rows:\n```\nXX\n X\n X\n```\n(where the top-left block is the origin)\nIf rotated right once:\n` (x,y)`\n`(0,0) (1,0)`\n`      (1,1) (2,1)`\nbecomes\n` (x,y)`\n`      (0,1)`\n` (0,0) (1,0)`\n` (1,-1)` (This isn't standard rotation, standard is usually around a center)\n\nLet's use the typical Tetris Z piece shapes:\nDefault: `##.`\n         `.##` (occupies (0,0),(1,0), (1,1),(2,1) relative to its top-leftmost block)\nRotated Right: ` .#`\n               `##.`\n               `#..` (occupies (1,0), (0,1),(1,1), (0,2) relative to its top-leftmost block)\n\nIf we rotate it right once, it would look like this:\n`   X` (col+1, row)\n`  XX` (col, row+1), (col+1, row+1)\n` X  ` (col, row+2)\nIf this is placed at column 4:\n`      `\n`   X  ` (col 5, height 0)\n`  XX  ` (col 4, height 1), (col 5, height 1)\n` X    ` (col 4, height 2)\nThis would make C4 height 3, C5 height 2. This is also a valid way to build the right side, but creates a slight difference in height.\n\nComparing options:\n*   **Option A: No rotation, move right 2x (to C4,C5,C6).**\n    *   Board: `[3,3,3,3,1,2,2,0,0,0]` (C4=1, C5=2, C6=2)\n*   **Option B: Rotate Right 1x, move right 2x (to C4,C5).** (assuming the lowest part of the rotated piece ends up at row 0)\n    *   The rotated Z piece is (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0) - (bottom to top, left to right)\n    *   This would mean:\n        *   Block at (Col+0, Row+0)\n        *   Block at (Col+0, Row+1)\n        *   Block at (Col+1, Row+1)\n        *   Block at (Col+1, Row+2)\n    *   If placed such that the lowest point is at row 0, it would look like:\n        `   X ` (Col+1, H=2)\n        `  XX ` (Col+0, H=1), (Col+1, H=1)\n        ` X   ` (Col+0, H=0)\n    *   If placed at column 4:\n        ` C4 C5`\n        `   X ` (C5, H=2)\n        `  XX ` (C4, H=1), (C5, H=1)\n        ` X   ` (C4, H=0)\n    *   Board: `[3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]` (C4=3, C5=3). This fills up columns 4 and 5 to the same height as columns 0-3. This looks like a very good option, as it levels out the board significantly.\n\nThe most optimal move here is to try and level the board, or at least build a solid base.\nOption B (Rotate Right 1x, move right to C4) seems to achieve this best by filling C4 and C5 to height 3, matching the existing wall. This creates a large flat surface at height 3, which is excellent for future Tetris opportunities.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve Option B:\n1.  `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to get the vertical Z shape)\n2.  `RIGHT` (to move it from default spawn in C3,C4,C5,C6 to C4,C5).\n    *   Default spawn for Z-piece is usually centered, e.g., blocks starting at (3,2),(4,2), (4,3),(5,3).\n    *   If the Z-piece spawns with its leftmost block in column 3, and occupies 3 columns in width (like rotated Z), it might start in C3, C4, C5.\n    *   If it spawns like `##` ` .##` at columns 3,4,5,6 relative to its actual blocks:\n        `(3,y), (4,y)`\n        `      (4,y+1), (5,y+1)`\n    *   After `ROTATE_RIGHT`, the piece will be:\n        `   X ` (relative to spawn origin, this would be (col+1, row))\n        `  XX ` (relative to spawn origin, (col, row+1), (col+1, row+1))\n        ` X   ` (relative to spawn origin, (col, row+2))\n    *   Let's assume the piece spawns with its 'center' around column 4. The leftmost block of the Z-piece in its initial orientation is at column 3.\n        *   Initial horizontal Z-piece position (spawn usually near top center):\n            `     Z Z`\n            `    Z Z `\n        *   If the spawn point is such that the leftmost block is at col 3 (or the whole piece spans col 3,4,5,6), then after one `RIGHT` move, the piece shifts to col 4,5,6,7.\n        *   The target placement is (C4,C5) for the rotated Z. This means moving it `RIGHT` once or twice might be needed after rotation.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate placement after rotation. Standard Z-piece: `(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1)` assuming spawn point is (X,Y) for (0,0).\n        Rotated Right Z-piece: `(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(0,2)`.\n        The left-most column occupied is `col + min(0,1) = col`. The right-most is `col + max(0,1,1,1) = col+1`.\n        So it occupies 2 columns.\n\n        The problem states `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n        The active piece is Z_Piece.\n        Tetris pieces spawn high up. The Z piece usually spawns so its left part is in column 3.\n        Initial Z shape: `(3,19), (4,19), (4,18), (5,18)` (assuming standard spawn rows).\n        Board from C0-C9: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        If we `ROTATE_RIGHT` this Z piece:\n        `(4,19), (3,18), (4,18), (3,17)`\n        Blocks are in C3, C4. Its lowest points would be C3 (height 0) and C4 (height 0).\n        Landing position:\n        The blocks would land on row 0.\n        C3 gets a block at row 0 (from (3,17)).\n        C4 gets a block at row 0 (from (4,18)).\n        C3 gets a block at row 1 (from (3,18)).\n        C4 gets a block at row 1 (from (4,19)).\n        This would make C3 height 2, C4 height 2.\n        This would result in `[3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]`. This isn't matching the height 3, it's lower.\n\n        Let's reconsider the standard Z-piece shape and rotation and placement logic:\n        Z-Piece (initial):\n        . Z Z\n        Z Z .\n\n        Spawn position (relative to board origin, high up):\n        Block 1: (Col_S, Row_S)\n        Block 2: (Col_S+1, Row_S)\n        Block 3: (Col_S+1, Row_S-1)\n        Block 4: (Col_S+2, Row_S-1)\n\n        If Col_S = 3 (typical spawn):\n        (3, Y), (4, Y)\n        (4, Y-1), (5, Y-1)\n\n        Board: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        Possible landing spots for initial Z-piece (no rotation):\n        *   If placed at `x=2`: `[3,3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0,0]`  -> C2 will be (3), C3 (3+block), C4 (block), C5 (block). This creates a hole under C3. Not good.\n        *   If placed at `x=3` (default spawn x, if not moved):\n            Blocks at (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1)\n            The lowest point of the piece is at row 0, above columns 3, 4, 5.\n            C3 has height 3. The lowest block of Z piece over C3 would land on top of the C3 block.\n            The block (3,Y) lands at C3 height 4.\n            The block (4,Y) lands at C4 height 1.\n            The block (4,Y-1) lands at C4 height 2.\n            The block (5,Y-1) lands at C5 height 1.\n            Result: `[3,3,3,4,2,1,0,0,0,0]`. This is uneven and high.\n\n        *   If moved `RIGHT` once (x=4):\n            Blocks at (4,Y), (5,Y), (5,Y-1), (6,Y-1)\n            C4 height 1\n            C5 height 2\n            C6 height 1\n            Result: `[3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]`. This is much better, starting to fill the right side.\n\n        *   If moved `RIGHT` twice (x=5):\n            Blocks at (5,Y), (6,Y), (6,Y-1), (7,Y-1)\n            C5 height 1\n            C6 height 2\n            C7 height 1\n            Result: `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`. Also good.\n\n        Now consider `ROTATE_RIGHT` first, then move.\n        Rotated Z-Piece:\n        . . Z\n        . Z Z\n        . Z .\n        This is typically `(Col_S+1, Row_S)`, `(Col_S, Row_S-1)`, `(Col_S+1, Row_S-1)`, `(Col_S, Row_S-2)`\n        If Col_S = 3 (spawn point):\n        (4, Y), (3, Y-1), (4, Y-1), (3, Y-2)\n\n        *   If placed at spawn x (cols 3,4):\n            Lowest blocks are at C3 (Y-2) and C4 (Y-1).\n            C3 height 3+1 = 4 (topmost block (3,Y-1) + bottom block (3,Y-2))\n            C4 height 3+1 = 4 (topmost block (4,Y) + bottom block (4,Y-1))\n            Result: `[3,3,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]`. This effectively levels C3 and C4 to height 4. This is a very clean build! It continues the wall and makes it taller. This seems like the most effective immediate move to create a flat, high surface.\n\n        Let's compare this with `RIGHT, RIGHT` (no rotation).\n        `[3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]` vs `[3,3,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]`\n        The rotated option `[3,3,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]` maintains a flat surface across C0-C4, which is excellent for future Tetris clears, even though it raises the overall height. It prioritizes creating a large, flat clearing opportunity.\n\n        So, the plan would be:\n        1. Rotate Right (to get the vertical Z)\n        2. No horizontal movement is needed, as the rotated piece will naturally land with its leftmost block in C3, resting on the existing C3 block and extending into C4.\n\n        The problem states: \"The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.\" This means I only need to choose one action at a time.\n        My optimal plan involves a `ROTATE_RIGHT`. After this, the piece will fall. If it doesn't align perfectly (e.g., if there's a horizontal shift needed), I will need to correct it in the next turn.\n\n        However, the interpretation of Z-piece rotation is critical.\n        Let's use a standard representation for the Z piece:\n        Initial:\n        `..##..`\n        `.##...`\n        (origin at top-left of the bounding box)\n\n        Rotate right:\n        `..#...`\n        `.##...`\n        `.#....`\n\n        If a Z piece spawns with its top-leftmost block at (col 3, row Y).\n        Initial blocks: (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1)\n        After ROTATE_RIGHT:\n        (4,Y), (3,Y-1), (4,Y-1), (3,Y-2)\n        These blocks would drop. The lowest row occupied is Y-2. The lowest columns are 3 and 4.\n        The piece's structure is such that it would cover cells (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) relative to the lowest row/leftmost column it covers.\n        Specifically, `(3, Y-2)` will land on top of C3, making C3 height 4.\n        `(4, Y-1)` will land on top of C4, making C4 height 1.\n        `(3, Y-1)` will land on top of C3, making C3 height 5. (Mistake in previous analysis, I added +1, but it's 2 blocks in C3).\n        `(4, Y)` will land on top of C4, making C4 height 2.\n        Result: `[3,3,3,5,2,0,0,0,0,0]`\n        This is not good as it creates an uneven surface with a hole at C4.\n\n        Let's retry the rotation logic for the Z piece carefully.\n        Standard Z Piece:\n        `XX.` (relative coordinates (0,0), (1,0))\n        `.XX` (relative coordinates (1,1), (2,1))\n        Spawn position: Let's assume (3, 19) is the (0,0) of the piece's bounding box.\n        Blocks: (3,19), (4,19), (4,18), (5,18).\n\n        Rotate Right around (1.5, 0.5) (typical rotation center for Z)\n        New blocks:\n        (4,19), (3,18), (4,18), (3,17) - this is what I got.\n\n        If this rotated piece falls:\n        - C3 has blocks at Y-2 (0-indexed board row) and Y-1 (1-indexed board row). This means C3 takes up 2 vertical cells.\n        - C4 has blocks at Y-1 (0-indexed board row) and Y (1-indexed board row). This means C4 takes up 2 vertical cells.\n\n        Current Board: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        If the piece drops:\n        C3 already has height 3. The new blocks add 2 to its height. So C3 becomes 3+2 = 5.\n        C4 already has height 0. The new blocks add 2 to its height. So C4 becomes 0+2 = 2.\n        Resulting board heights: `[3,3,3,5,2,0,0,0,0,0]`. This creates a deep hole (5 vs 2). This is a bad placement.\n\n        So, `ROTATE_RIGHT` is NOT a good initial move if no horizontal shift is made.\n\n        The initial Z-piece (no rotation)\n        `XX.`\n        `.XX`\n        If it moves RIGHT twice (lands in C5, C6, C7):\n        Blocks: (5,Y), (6,Y), (6,Y-1), (7,Y-1).\n        When it drops, it will land on the bottom (row 0).\n        C5 gets height 1 (from (5,Y)).\n        C6 gets height 2 (from (6,Y) and (6,Y-1)).\n        C7 gets height 1 (from (7,Y-1)).\n        Resulting board heights: `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`. This starts to build the right side in a reasonable way, avoiding creating holes or over-extacking.\n        This seems like the best strategy for the Z piece.\n\n        The plan is to move the Z-piece to the right side of the board without rotating it.\n        The piece starts with its leftmost block at Col 3. To reach Col 5, it needs to move `RIGHT` twice.\n        The first action should be `RIGHT`.\n\nFinal check of piece coordinates and desired outcome:\nBoard: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nActive Piece: Z_Piece\nShape (relative to top-left of bounding box):\n`  #` (0,0) (1,0)\n` ##` (1,1) (2,1)\nSpawn usually centered, e.g., (col 3, row Y) for (0,0).\nSo blocks are at: (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1)\n\nIf moved RIGHT 2 times:\nNew (0,0) would be (5,Y).\nBlocks are at: (5,Y), (6,Y), (6,Y-1), (7,Y-1).\nThese will drop to the bottom (row 0).\nC5: height 1 (from (5,Y) at row 0).\nC6: height 2 (from (6,Y) at row 0 and (6,Y-1) at row 1).\nC7: height 1 (from (7,Y-1) at row 0).\nFinal board state: `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`\n\nThis placement begins to build up the right side of the board without creating new holes or exacerbating existing height differences prematurely. It's a conservative but safe move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT\nCurrent action is the first one.\nthought: The current board has a wall of height 3 in columns 0-3 and is completely empty from columns 4-9. The active piece is a Z_Piece.\nThe goal is to effectively use the Z-piece to start building up the right side of the board (columns 4-9) without creating any immediate holes or making the existing height disparity worse.\n\nLet's consider the initial orientation of the Z-piece and its possible placements. The Z-piece typically spans 3 columns horizontally if it lands flat. If it spawns with its leftmost block in column 3, its blocks are effectively in columns 3, 4, and 5.\n\n1.  **Placing the Z-piece without rotation:**\n    *   If the Z-piece is dropped without any horizontal movement (assuming default spawn at col 3), its left two blocks would sit on top of the existing height 3 block in column 3, and extend into the empty columns 4 and 5. This would likely create an uneven surface (e.g., C3 becomes taller, C4 and C5 start low, potentially creating a hole in C4 relative to C3).\n    *   If the Z-piece is moved to the right, to completely land within the empty columns 4-9.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` once would place the piece starting at column 4. Its blocks would occupy columns 4, 5, and 6. This would make C4 height 1, C5 height 2, and C6 height 1, which is a good way to start building the right side.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` twice would place the piece starting at column 5. Its blocks would occupy columns 5, 6, and 7. This would make C5 height 1, C6 height 2, and C7 height 1. This is also a good, clean start to building.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` thrice would place the piece starting at column 6. Its blocks would occupy columns 6, 7, and 8. This would make C6 height 1, C7 height 2, and C8 height 1. Also good.\n\n2.  **Placing the Z-piece after rotation:**\n    *   If the Z-piece is rotated (e.g., `ROTATE_RIGHT`), it typically becomes more vertical. From its default horizontal orientation, `XX./.XX`, a `ROTATE_RIGHT` would yield something like `.X./.XX/X..`. This rotated piece usually occupies 2 columns.\n    *   If rotated and then dropped without horizontal movement (assuming spawn left-most at column 3), the rotated piece's blocks would land on columns 3 and 4. Given the current board (C3 at height 3, C4 at height 0), this would likely create a severe height difference (C3 would become much taller, C4 would become height 2 or 3, leaving a significant \"hole\" or \"well\" next to C3). This is generally undesirable.\n\nComparing options, placing the Z-piece unrotated into the empty right side of the board appears to be the safest and most effective strategy for the current state. Moving it to column 5 (by moving `RIGHT` twice) creates a low, stable base for further building.\n\nThe full plan is to move the Z-piece two times to the right, then let it drop. The current action needs to be the first of these two 'RIGHT' moves.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT\nmove: RIGHT",
    "thought": "The board has a flat block of height 3 in columns 0-3 and is completely empty from columns 4-9. The active piece is a Z-piece.\n\nThe Z-piece can be placed in a few ways:\n1.  **Default orientation (horizontal Z):** This occupies 2x2 space.\n    *   If placed starting in column 2: `[3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0,0,0]` This would create an awkward 4-height block in C2, C3, and C4, C5 while leaving a height of 3 in C0, C1. It would also create a hole at the bottom of C3 or C2 if placed adjacent to the existing wall.\n    *   If placed starting in column 3: `[3,3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0,0]` This would sit on top of the C3 block, pushing C3 to height 4, and building C4, C5 to height 1 (if placed on row 0) or higher. This is still awkward.\n    *   **Best option for default orientation:** Place it in the empty area on the right, for example, starting at column 4. `[3,3,3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0]` This would mean C4 and C5 would be at height 1 (or 0, if it lands on the very bottom). This is a good way to start building the right side.\n\n2.  **Rotated orientation (vertical Z):** This occupies 2x3 space (or 3x2, depending on how you visualize it).\n    *   If rotated right once, it looks like a vertical stack. `[_,Z][Z,_][_,Z]`. When placed, it would typically cover 2 columns.\n    *   `[Z,_,Z,_]`\n    *   `[_,Z,_,Z]` (or vice versa)\n    *   If rotated right (or left) once, the Z-piece takes the shape:\n        `X `\n        `XX`\n        ` X`\n    *   Placing this rotated piece on the far right (e.g., in columns 7-8 or 8-9) would also be a good way to build the right side, without touching the existing wall.\n\nConsidering the immediate goal of creating a stable base and avoiding holes, placing the Z-piece entirely within the empty columns (4-9) is the most favorable strategy.\n\nLet's evaluate the standard orientation (no rotation) and moving it to the right:\n*   **Move Right 1x:** Piece would be in columns (3,4,5,6). It would land on the top of C3, building C3 to height 4, and placing blocks in C4, C5. This is okay, but not ideal as it would create a 4-height block and extend the current flat 3-height surface.\n*   **Move Right 2x:** Piece would be in columns (4,5,6,7). This means it would land entirely on the empty columns. The Z-piece blocks would occupy (col 4, row 0), (col 5, row 0), (col 5, row 1), (col 6, row 1). This would make C4 height 1, C5 height 2, C6 height 2. This is a clean start to building the right side.\n*   **Move Right 3x:** Piece would be in columns (5,6,7,8). This would make C5 height 1, C6 height 2, C7 height 2. Also a clean start.\n*   **Move Right 4x:** Piece would be in columns (6,7,8,9). This would make C6 height 1, C7 height 2, C8 height 2. Also a clean start.\n\nNow let's consider rotating. A Z-piece rotated 90 degrees looks like:\n```\n  X\n XX\n X\n```\nOr, if you see it as occupying 2 columns and 3 rows:\n```\nXX\n X\n X\n```\n(where the top-left block is the origin)\nIf rotated right once:\n` (x,y)`\n`(0,0) (1,0)`\n`      (1,1) (2,1)`\nbecomes\n` (x,y)`\n`      (0,1)`\n` (0,0) (1,0)`\n` (1,-1)` (This isn't standard rotation, standard is usually around a center)\n\nLet's use the typical Tetris Z piece shapes:\nDefault: `##.`\n         `.##` (occupies (0,0),(1,0), (1,1),(2,1) relative to its top-leftmost block)\nRotated Right: ` .#`\n               `##.`\n               `#..` (occupies (1,0), (0,1),(1,1), (0,2) relative to its top-leftmost block)\n\nIf we rotate it right once, it would look like this:\n`   X` (col+1, row)\n`  XX` (col, row+1), (col+1, row+1)\n` X  ` (col, row+2)\nIf this is placed at column 4:\n`      `\n`   X  ` (col 5, height 0)\n`  XX  ` (col 4, height 1), (col 5, height 1)\n` X    ` (col 4, height 2)\nThis would make C4 height 3, C5 height 2. This is also a valid way to build the right side, but creates a slight difference in height.\n\nComparing options:\n*   **Option A: No rotation, move right 2x (to C4,C5,C6).**\n    *   Board: `[3,3,3,3,1,2,2,0,0,0]` (C4=1, C5=2, C6=2)\n*   **Option B: Rotate Right 1x, move right 2x (to C4,C5).** (assuming the lowest part of the rotated piece ends up at row 0)\n    *   The rotated Z piece is (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0) - (bottom to top, left to right)\n    *   This would mean:\n        *   Block at (Col+0, Row+0)\n        *   Block at (Col+0, Row+1)\n        *   Block at (Col+1, Row+1)\n        *   Block at (Col+1, Row+2)\n    *   If placed such that the lowest point is at row 0, it would look like:\n        `   X ` (Col+1, H=2)\n        `  XX ` (Col+0, H=1), (Col+1, H=1)\n        ` X   ` (Col+0, H=0)\n    *   If placed at column 4:\n        ` C4 C5`\n        `   X ` (C5, H=2)\n        `  XX ` (C4, H=1), (C5, H=1)\n        ` X   ` (C4, H=0)\n    *   Board: `[3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0]` (C4=3, C5=3). This fills up columns 4 and 5 to the same height as columns 0-3. This looks like a very good option, as it levels out the board significantly.\n\nThe most optimal move here is to try and level the board, or at least build a solid base.\nOption B (Rotate Right 1x, move right to C4) seems to achieve this best by filling C4 and C5 to height 3, matching the existing wall. This creates a large flat surface at height 3, which is excellent for future Tetris opportunities.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve Option B:\n1.  `ROTATE_RIGHT` (to get the vertical Z shape)\n2.  `RIGHT` (to move it from default spawn in C3,C4,C5,C6 to C4,C5).\n    *   Default spawn for Z-piece is usually centered, e.g., blocks starting at (3,2),(4,2), (4,3),(5,3).\n    *   If the Z-piece spawns with its leftmost block in column 3, and occupies 3 columns in width (like rotated Z), it might start in C3, C4, C5.\n    *   If it spawns like `##` ` .##` at columns 3,4,5,6 relative to its actual blocks:\n        `(3,y), (4,y)`\n        `      (4,y+1), (5,y+1)`\n    *   After `ROTATE_RIGHT`, the piece will be:\n        `   X ` (relative to spawn origin, this would be (col+1, row))\n        `  XX ` (relative to spawn origin, (col, row+1), (col+1, row+1))\n        ` X   ` (relative to spawn origin, (col, row+2))\n    *   Let's assume the piece spawns with its 'center' around column 4. The leftmost block of the Z-piece in its initial orientation is at column 3.\n        *   Initial horizontal Z-piece position (spawn usually near top center):\n            `     Z Z`\n            `    Z Z `\n        *   If the spawn point is such that the leftmost block is at col 3 (or the whole piece spans col 3,4,5,6), then after one `RIGHT` move, the piece shifts to col 4,5,6,7.\n        *   The target placement is (C4,C5) for the rotated Z. This means moving it `RIGHT` once or twice might be needed after rotation.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate placement after rotation. Standard Z-piece: `(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1)` assuming spawn point is (X,Y) for (0,0).\n        Rotated Right Z-piece: `(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(0,2)`.\n        The left-most column occupied is `col + min(0,1) = col`. The right-most is `col + max(0,1,1,1) = col+1`.\n        So it occupies 2 columns.\n\n        The problem states `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n        The active piece is Z_Piece.\n        Tetris pieces spawn high up. The Z piece usually spawns so its left part is in column 3.\n        Initial Z shape: `(3,19), (4,19), (4,18), (5,18)` (assuming standard spawn rows).\n        Board from C0-C9: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        If we `ROTATE_RIGHT` this Z piece:\n        `(4,19), (3,18), (4,18), (3,17)`\n        Blocks are in C3, C4. Its lowest points would be C3 (height 0) and C4 (height 0).\n        Landing position:\n        The blocks would land on row 0.\n        C3 gets a block at row 0 (from (3,17)).\n        C4 gets a block at row 0 (from (4,18)).\n        C3 gets a block at row 1 (from (3,18)).\n        C4 gets a block at row 1 (from (4,19)).\n        This would make C3 height 2, C4 height 2.\n        This would result in `[3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]`. This isn't matching the height 3, it's lower.\n\n        Let's reconsider the standard Z-piece shape and rotation and placement logic:\n        Z-Piece (initial):\n        . Z Z\n        Z Z .\n\n        Spawn position (relative to board origin, high up):\n        Block 1: (Col_S, Row_S)\n        Block 2: (Col_S+1, Row_S)\n        Block 3: (Col_S+1, Row_S-1)\n        Block 4: (Col_S+2, Row_S-1)\n\n        If Col_S = 3 (typical spawn):\n        (3, Y), (4, Y)\n        (4, Y-1), (5, Y-1)\n\n        Board: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        Possible landing spots for initial Z-piece (no rotation):\n        *   If placed at `x=2`: `[3,3,3,Z,Z,Z,Z,0,0,0]`  -> C2 will be (3), C3 (3+block), C4 (block), C5 (block). This creates a hole under C3. Not good.\n        *   If placed at `x=3` (default spawn x, if not moved):\n            Blocks at (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1)\n            The lowest point of the piece is at row 0, above columns 3, 4, 5.\n            C3 has height 3. The lowest block of Z piece over C3 would land on top of the C3 block.\n            The block (3,Y) lands at C3 height 4.\n            The block (4,Y) lands at C4 height 1.\n            The block (4,Y-1) lands at C4 height 2.\n            The block (5,Y-1) lands at C5 height 1.\n            Result: `[3,3,3,4,2,1,0,0,0,0]`. This is uneven and high.\n\n        *   If moved `RIGHT` once (x=4):\n            Blocks at (4,Y), (5,Y), (5,Y-1), (6,Y-1)\n            C4 height 1\n            C5 height 2\n            C6 height 1\n            Result: `[3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]`. This is much better, starting to fill the right side.\n\n        *   If moved `RIGHT` twice (x=5):\n            Blocks at (5,Y), (6,Y), (6,Y-1), (7,Y-1)\n            C5 height 1\n            C6 height 2\n            C7 height 1\n            Result: `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`. Also good.\n\n        Now consider `ROTATE_RIGHT` first, then move.\n        Rotated Z-Piece:\n        . . Z\n        . Z Z\n        . Z .\n        This is typically `(Col_S+1, Row_S)`, `(Col_S, Row_S-1)`, `(Col_S+1, Row_S-1)`, `(Col_S, Row_S-2)`\n        If Col_S = 3 (spawn point):\n        (4, Y), (3, Y-1), (4, Y-1), (3, Y-2)\n\n        *   If placed at spawn x (cols 3,4):\n            Lowest blocks are at C3 (Y-2) and C4 (Y-1).\n            C3 height 3+1 = 4 (topmost block (3,Y-1) + bottom block (3,Y-2))\n            C4 height 3+1 = 4 (topmost block (4,Y) + bottom block (4,Y-1))\n            Result: `[3,3,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]`. This effectively levels C3 and C4 to height 4. This is a very clean build! It continues the wall and makes it taller. This seems like the most effective immediate move to create a flat, high surface.\n\n        Let's compare this with `RIGHT, RIGHT` (no rotation).\n        `[3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]` vs `[3,3,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]`\n        The rotated option `[3,3,3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0]` maintains a flat surface across C0-C4, which is excellent for future Tetris clears, even though it raises the overall height. It prioritizes creating a large, flat clearing opportunity.\n\n        So, the plan would be:\n        1. Rotate Right (to get the vertical Z)\n        2. No horizontal movement is needed, as the rotated piece will naturally land with its leftmost block in C3, resting on the existing C3 block and extending into C4.\n\n        The problem states: \"The environment performs the final drop automatically after the chosen action.\" This means I only need to choose one action at a time.\n        My optimal plan involves a `ROTATE_RIGHT`. After this, the piece will fall. If it doesn't align perfectly (e.g., if there's a horizontal shift needed), I will need to correct it in the next turn.\n\n        However, the interpretation of Z-piece rotation is critical.\n        Let's use a standard representation for the Z piece:\n        Initial:\n        `..##..`\n        `.##...`\n        (origin at top-left of the bounding box)\n\n        Rotate right:\n        `..#...`\n        `.##...`\n        `.#....`\n\n        If a Z piece spawns with its top-leftmost block at (col 3, row Y).\n        Initial blocks: (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1)\n        After ROTATE_RIGHT:\n        (4,Y), (3,Y-1), (4,Y-1), (3,Y-2)\n        These blocks would drop. The lowest row occupied is Y-2. The lowest columns are 3 and 4.\n        The piece's structure is such that it would cover cells (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) relative to the lowest row/leftmost column it covers.\n        Specifically, `(3, Y-2)` will land on top of C3, making C3 height 4.\n        `(4, Y-1)` will land on top of C4, making C4 height 1.\n        `(3, Y-1)` will land on top of C3, making C3 height 5. (Mistake in previous analysis, I added +1, but it's 2 blocks in C3).\n        `(4, Y)` will land on top of C4, making C4 height 2.\n        Result: `[3,3,3,5,2,0,0,0,0,0]`\n        This is not good as it creates an uneven surface with a hole at C4.\n\n        Let's retry the rotation logic for the Z piece carefully.\n        Standard Z Piece:\n        `XX.` (relative coordinates (0,0), (1,0))\n        `.XX` (relative coordinates (1,1), (2,1))\n        Spawn position: Let's assume (3, 19) is the (0,0) of the piece's bounding box.\n        Blocks: (3,19), (4,19), (4,18), (5,18).\n\n        Rotate Right around (1.5, 0.5) (typical rotation center for Z)\n        New blocks:\n        (4,19), (3,18), (4,18), (3,17) - this is what I got.\n\n        If this rotated piece falls:\n        - C3 has blocks at Y-2 (0-indexed board row) and Y-1 (1-indexed board row). This means C3 takes up 2 vertical cells.\n        - C4 has blocks at Y-1 (0-indexed board row) and Y (1-indexed board row). This means C4 takes up 2 vertical cells.\n\n        Current Board: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        If the piece drops:\n        C3 already has height 3. The new blocks add 2 to its height. So C3 becomes 3+2 = 5.\n        C4 already has height 0. The new blocks add 2 to its height. So C4 becomes 0+2 = 2.\n        Resulting board heights: `[3,3,3,5,2,0,0,0,0,0]`. This creates a deep hole (5 vs 2). This is a bad placement.\n\n        So, `ROTATE_RIGHT` is NOT a good initial move if no horizontal shift is made.\n\n        The initial Z-piece (no rotation)\n        `XX.`\n        `.XX`\n        If it moves RIGHT twice (lands in C5, C6, C7):\n        Blocks: (5,Y), (6,Y), (6,Y-1), (7,Y-1).\n        When it drops, it will land on the bottom (row 0).\n        C5 gets height 1 (from (5,Y)).\n        C6 gets height 2 (from (6,Y) and (6,Y-1)).\n        C7 gets height 1 (from (7,Y-1)).\n        Resulting board heights: `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`. This starts to build the right side in a reasonable way, avoiding creating holes or over-extacking.\n        This seems like the best strategy for the Z piece.\n\n        The plan is to move the Z-piece to the right side of the board without rotating it.\n        The piece starts with its leftmost block at Col 3. To reach Col 5, it needs to move `RIGHT` twice.\n        The first action should be `RIGHT`.\n\nFinal check of piece coordinates and desired outcome:\nBoard: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nActive Piece: Z_Piece\nShape (relative to top-left of bounding box):\n`  #` (0,0) (1,0)\n` ##` (1,1) (2,1)\nSpawn usually centered, e.g., (col 3, row Y) for (0,0).\nSo blocks are at: (3,Y), (4,Y), (4,Y-1), (5,Y-1)\n\nIf moved RIGHT 2 times:\nNew (0,0) would be (5,Y).\nBlocks are at: (5,Y), (6,Y), (6,Y-1), (7,Y-1).\nThese will drop to the bottom (row 0).\nC5: height 1 (from (5,Y) at row 0).\nC6: height 2 (from (6,Y) at row 0 and (6,Y-1) at row 1).\nC7: height 1 (from (7,Y-1) at row 0).\nFinal board state: `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`\n\nThis placement begins to build up the right side of the board without creating new holes or exacerbating existing height differences prematurely. It's a conservative but safe move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT\nCurrent action is the first one.\nthought: The current board has a wall of height 3 in columns 0-3 and is completely empty from columns 4-9. The active piece is a Z_Piece.\nThe goal is to effectively use the Z-piece to start building up the right side of the board (columns 4-9) without creating any immediate holes or making the existing height disparity worse.\n\nLet's consider the initial orientation of the Z-piece and its possible placements. The Z-piece typically spans 3 columns horizontally if it lands flat. If it spawns with its leftmost block in column 3, its blocks are effectively in columns 3, 4, and 5.\n\n1.  **Placing the Z-piece without rotation:**\n    *   If the Z-piece is dropped without any horizontal movement (assuming default spawn at col 3), its left two blocks would sit on top of the existing height 3 block in column 3, and extend into the empty columns 4 and 5. This would likely create an uneven surface (e.g., C3 becomes taller, C4 and C5 start low, potentially creating a hole in C4 relative to C3).\n    *   If the Z-piece is moved to the right, to completely land within the empty columns 4-9.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` once would place the piece starting at column 4. Its blocks would occupy columns 4, 5, and 6. This would make C4 height 1, C5 height 2, and C6 height 1, which is a good way to start building the right side.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` twice would place the piece starting at column 5. Its blocks would occupy columns 5, 6, and 7. This would make C5 height 1, C6 height 2, and C7 height 1. This is also a good, clean start to building.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` thrice would place the piece starting at column 6. Its blocks would occupy columns 6, 7, and 8. This would make C6 height 1, C7 height 2, and C8 height 1. Also good.\n\n2.  **Placing the Z-piece after rotation:**\n    *   If the Z-piece is rotated (e.g., `ROTATE_RIGHT`), it typically becomes more vertical. From its default horizontal orientation, `XX./.XX`, a `ROTATE_RIGHT` would yield something like `.X./.XX/X..`. This rotated piece usually occupies 2 columns.\n    *   If rotated and then dropped without horizontal movement (assuming spawn left-most at column 3), the rotated piece's blocks would land on columns 3 and 4. Given the current board (C3 at height 3, C4 at height 0), this would likely create a severe height difference (C3 would become much taller, C4 would become height 2 or 3, leaving a significant \"hole\" or \"well\" next to C3). This is generally undesirable.\n\nComparing options, placing the Z-piece unrotated into the empty right side of the board appears to be the safest and most effective strategy for the current state. Moving it to column 5 (by moving `RIGHT` twice) creates a low, stable base for further building.\n\nThe full plan is to move the Z-piece two times to the right, then let it drop. The current action needs to be the first of these two 'RIGHT' moves.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT",

The current board is characterized by elevated columns on the left (C0-C1 at height 5, C2-C3 at height 3) and a completely empty right side (C4-C9 at height 0), forming a very deep well.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    No previous move or thought process was provided, so an evaluation is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area of concern is the significant height disparity between the left (C0-C3) and right (C4-C9) sides of the board. The left side is building up, while the right side is entirely empty, creating a large, deep well. This well, if not managed, can become difficult to fill evenly and lead to further height increases on the left. There are likely hidden holes under the higher columns on the left, though the exact locations are not detailed.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current piece is a Z-piece.\n    *   **Prioritize filling the well:** The empty C4-C9 section needs attention. Pieces should ideally be used to build a flat base here to prepare for future line clears.\n    *   **Address left-side height:** While filling the well, opportunities to reduce the height on the left side (C0-C3) should also be considered.\n    *   **Z-piece placement:** The Z-piece could be used to cap off small 2-wide gaps or to extend a flat surface. On the empty right side, it can start to build up the base in a way that minimizes new irregularities, or it could be placed horizontally to cover two columns at a height of 1. Care must be taken if placing it on the left to avoid creating new holes or exacerbating existing unevenness. It's generally not ideal for directly clearing lines in a deep well.",

The right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As there is no previous context or information about the last move, its effectiveness cannot be evaluated.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Left Side (Columns 0-2):** These columns are dangerously high (heights 8, 9, 8), indicating an urgent need for line clears to prevent topping out.\n    *   **The Deep Well (Between Column 2 and 3):** There is a substantial height difference (8 to 3) forming a deep \"well.\" This area is critical; it could be a setup for a line clear if filled correctly, but also a source of potential holes if mismanaged.\n    *   **The Empty Right Side (Columns 4-9):** This large empty expanse offers significant maneuvering room but also an opportunity to build a new, flatter base or exacerbate height differences if not utilized strategically.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears:** With heights on the left reaching 9, clearing lines is paramount to reduce overall board height and prevent game over.\n    *   **Address the Well:** Look for pieces that can effectively fill the gap between column 2 and 3 to either clear lines or flatten the surface.\n    *   **Maintain Flatness:** While clearing lines, aim to minimize new holes and keep the board as flat as possible, especially in the central and right areas to avoid creating new complex structures.\n    *   **Adaptability:** Since the active piece is unknown, the next move needs to be highly adaptable. The primary goal should be to either directly clear lines on the left or set up for future clears while preserving the empty space on the right for maneuvering.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As this is the initial observation provided, there's no previous context to compare against. The current board presents a significant height disparity.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior observations or knowledge of the last move, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is severely imbalanced. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are significantly high (12, 13, 13), while column 3 has a deep well (height 3). The right side of the board (columns 4-9) is completely empty. The immediate priority is to address the large gap in column 3 and manage the high peaks on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal should be to level out the left side of the board and fill the deep well in column 3. Given the right side is entirely empty, it presents a potential opportunity for clearing lines, but only after the immediate problems on the left are addressed. With an \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, specific tactical advice is impossible, but the general strategy is:\n    *   Prioritize pieces that can fill the column 3 well without exacerbating the height on columns 0-2.\n    *   Look for opportunities to clear lines on the left to reduce overall height.\n    *   Avoid building up the right side prematurely, maintaining it as a low-risk zone until the left is stable.",

Any random movement could worsen the situation if the piece is not suitable for C3.\n\nTherefore, the safest move is NO_OP, hoping that the next piece will be identifiable or provide a better opportunity to plan. If I were forced to make a non-NO_OP move without knowing the piece, it would be purely speculative and likely suboptimal.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I will describe the current state as a new observation. The board is severely imbalanced. The left four columns (C0-C3) are uniformly high at 14 units, while the right six columns (C4-C9) are completely empty (0 units). This creates a massive void on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With no prior context or information about the last active piece and its placement, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the large height disparity. The right side of the board (columns C4-C9) is completely empty and needs to be built up. Conversely, the left side (C0-C3) is very high, and further pieces there risk game over. Specifically, the gap between C3 (height 14) and C4 (height 0) is the most prominent feature and demands immediate focus.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to **fill the right side of the board (C4-C9)**. All incoming pieces should be directed to these columns to reduce the extreme height difference and create a more level playing field. Avoid placing pieces on the high left side (C0-C3) unless it results in an immediate line clear. Building up the right side effectively creates a deep \"well\" that can be used for line clears, potentially setting up future Tetrises once the left side has also been managed.",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, direct comparison is impossible. However, the current board state is extremely unbalanced: columns 0-3 are significantly high (14-16), while columns 4-9 are completely empty, forming a massive, deep well on the right side.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Given the highly unbalanced and high board, recent moves (including potentially the last one) appear to have been ineffective at maintaining board balance or clearing lines efficiently. The current state is a significant challenge for survival.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The priority is the large, empty well spanning columns 4-9. This area needs to be built up strategically from the bottom to create opportunities for massive line clears. Simultaneously, the high stack in columns 0-3 presents an immediate threat and must be lowered.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to exploit the deep well on the right. Prioritize placing pieces in columns 4-9 to build a flat base, aiming for multi-line clears (especially Tetris clears with 'I' pieces if available). Avoid adding height to columns 0-3 unless it directly contributes to a critical line clear. With an UNKNOWN active piece, the current move should default to a NO_OP to await more information if possible, or attempt to move towards the well if a safe default is needed, but specific placement is impossible to recommend without knowing the piece.",

Any rotation or horizontal movement would be pure speculation and could lead to a detrimental outcome.

I am evaluating the board solely based on the current observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Information about the last move and the active piece is unavailable (`Active Piece: UNKNOWN`). Therefore, I cannot determine the effectiveness of any previous action.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a critical state. Columns 0 and 1 are at height 18, which is dangerously close to the top of the playfield (assuming a standard 20-row height). Column 2 is at 16, and Column 3 at 14. The right side of the board (Columns 4 through 9) is completely empty. This creates a severe height imbalance and a deep \"valley\" on the right. The immediate and most pressing area needing attention is the **leftmost side (C0-C1)** to prevent a game over.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be **survival through line clears**.\n    *   **Prioritize line clears:** Any active piece that can immediately clear a line on the high left side of the board should be used for that purpose, even if it means sacrificing optimal long-term placement.\n    *   **Avoid creating overhangs/holes:** Given the extreme height difference, care must be taken not to create new holes or impossible-to-fill overhangs on the left side, as this would hasten game over.\n    *   **Address the valley cautiously:** While the right side is empty, simply dropping pieces there will only widen the height disparity and create an even larger, unmanageable structure. If possible, consider pieces that can build up the right side while also working towards connecting to the left, ideally to create a flat surface for a future line clear. However, line clears on the left are paramount.\n    *   The board is highly unfavorable. Focus on short-term survival by clearing lines and try to create a more even surface from left to right if a suitable piece becomes available.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate changes. The board currently shows columns C0-C3 built up to significant heights (18, 19, 19, 14), while columns C4-C9 are entirely empty (height 0). This indicates a very uneven board state.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Information about the last move and its associated thought process is unavailable, so its effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the large, open expanse from column C4 to C9. While this offers immense potential for line clears, the surrounding high columns (C0-C3) pose a challenge. The primary goal is to manage the height disparity and begin filling the empty right side to set up multiple line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current strategy must focus on utilizing the wide empty well on the right (C4-C9).\n    *   **Prioritize Right Side:** Every piece should ideally contribute to filling the C4-C9 area, aiming for Tetris line clears to reduce the overall board height.\n    *   **Maintain Access:** Be cautious not to prematurely block access to the lower parts of the C4-C9 well, especially if an 'I' piece is anticipated for a Tetris clear.\n    *   **Manage Left Heights:** While focusing on the right, avoid increasing the heights of C0-C3 unless absolutely necessary or if it directly leads to an immediate line clear. The height difference is substantial, creating a potential topping-out risk on the left while the right is still empty.\n    *   **Active Piece Unknown:** With the active piece being 'UNKNOWN', specific placement advice is impossible. However, the general strategy should revolve around efficiently leveraging the large empty area to clear lines and normalize the board height.",

With a completely empty board, the optimal strategy is to begin setting up for a Tetris (4-line clear). The I-Line is perfectly suited for this. I should rotate the I-Line to a vertical orientation and place it in one of the far columns (e.g., column 0 or column 9) to create a \"well\" for future Tetris clears.
