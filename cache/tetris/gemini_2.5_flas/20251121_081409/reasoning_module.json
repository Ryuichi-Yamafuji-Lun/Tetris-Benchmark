    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I am unable to compare the current board state to past ones. The current board is very low, with heights of `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates blocks only in the first three columns, with column 0 being slightly higher than columns 1 and 2. The rest of the board (columns 3-9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the last move, I cannot directly evaluate its effectiveness. However, the current board state is relatively clean and low, which is generally a good sign. The minor unevenness in the first three columns is not a major issue at this stage.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the small height difference in the first three columns. Specifically, column 0 is at height 2, while columns 1 and 2 are at height 1. This creates a slight \"dip\" that should ideally be leveled out to maintain a flat playing field. The rest of the board (columns 3-9) is wide open and can be used for future stacking.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is a `T_Piece`. Given the current board state `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the most effective immediate strategy is to use the `T_Piece` to flatten the existing structure.\n    *   **Optimal Placement:** Rotating the `T_Piece` into a horizontal orientation (`###` base) and placing it such that its center block aligns with column 1, covering columns 0, 1, and 2, would result in new heights of `[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This would create a perfectly flat base at height 2, which is excellent for subsequent stacking.\n    *   **Long-term Goal:** Continue to build a flat board, potentially leaving a single column open on one side (e.g., column 9) for future Tetris (4-line) clears as the board height increases.\n    *   **Avoid:** Avoid creating new holes or significantly increasing height imbalances.\n\nTo execute the optimal placement, the `T_Piece` will likely need to be rotated and moved left.\n\n---\n**Action:** HARD_DROP",
    "response": "thought: The current board state is `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and the active piece is a `T_Piece`.\nA `T_Piece` has four possible rotations. The initial orientation (0 degrees) is a flat bar with a block sticking down from the middle.\n*   **0-degree rotation:** ` .#. ` / `###`\n*   **90-degree rotation (clockwise):** ` #. ` / `##` / ` #. `\n*   **180-degree rotation:** `###` / ` .#. `\n*   **270-degree rotation (clockwise):** ` .# ` / `##` / ` .# `\n\nOur goal is to flatten the existing unevenness `[2, 1, 1, ...]` to `[2, 2, 2, ...]`.\nTo achieve `[2, 2, 2]`, we need to place a block in column 1 and column 2, while not increasing column 0 significantly.\n\nLet's consider possible placements for the `T_Piece`:\n\n1.  **Placement Option 1 (0-degree rotation, ` .#. ` / `###`):**\n    If we place the base `###` starting at column 0, it would cover columns 0, 1, 2. The block sticking up would be in column 1.\n    This means:\n    *   Column 0: 2 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 3\n    *   Column 1: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) + 1 (T-piece top) = 3\n    *   Column 2: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 2\n    Result: `[3, 3, 2, ...]` - This creates new unevenness and increases height more than necessary.\n\n2.  **Placement Option 2 (180-degree rotation, `###` / ` .#. `):**\n    This is the inverted T-piece. If we place the flat top `###` to cover columns 0, 1, 2, the block sticking down would be in column 1.\n    *   Column 0: 2 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 3\n    *   Column 1: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) + 0 (T-piece block in hole) = 2\n    *   Column 2: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 2\n    Result: `[3, 2, 2, ...]` - This is better but still leaves a height of 3.\n\n3.  **Placement Option 3 (90-degree or 270-degree rotation - vertical T):**\n    Let's use the 90-degree rotation: ` #. ` / `##` / ` #. `\n    If we place this on the board, the center of the `##` part would go into a hole.\n    *   To place this to cover column 1 and 2, it would have to start at column 1.\n    *   If the vertical part is in column 1, and the horizontal part is in column 1 and 2.\n    *   This is difficult to visualize and fit perfectly to level the existing structure.\n\nThe best way to flatten `[2, 1, 1]` with a `T_Piece` is to rotate it to its \"flat\" orientation (`###` base with a block above, or `###` top with a block below) and place it such that the `###` part sits on columns 0, 1, 2, with the central block going into the hole at column 1.\n\nLet's rethink the standard T-piece rotation and its interaction with the board.\nA standard T-piece looks like:\n```\n  X\nXXX\n```\nIf we rotate it once clockwise (`ROTATE_RIGHT`), it looks like:\n```\nX\nXX\nX\n```\nIf we rotate it again (`ROTATE_RIGHT` twice from initial, or `ROTATE_LEFT` once from initial), it looks like:\n```\nXXX\n  X\n```\nThis is the \"upside down T\". This is the best orientation to fill a gap.\n\nLet's place this `XXX` on columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe T-piece has its center block at (x=0, y=1) assuming the bottom-left of its bounding box is (0,0) in its `XXX` / ` X ` orientation.\nWhen placed on the board:\n*   The `XXX` part will occupy cells `(col, board_height[col])` for col 0, 1, 2.\n*   The `X` below the middle will fall into the hole.\n\nLet's assume the T-piece `XXX` / ` X ` is placed such that its top row (`XXX`) is at height `H`.\nThe lowest block of the T-piece (the `X` in the middle below the `XXX`) will be at height `H-1` in the center column.\n\nCurrent heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nWe want to place the T-piece rotated to `XXX` / ` X ` to level columns 0, 1, 2.\nIf we place the `XXX` part on top of columns 0, 1, 2:\n*   Column 0 is at height 2.\n*   Column 1 is at height 1.\n*   Column 2 is at height 1.\n\nTo level them, we need to bring column 1 and 2 up to 2.\nThe `T_Piece` oriented as `XXX` / ` X ` could be placed such that the `XXX` covers columns 0, 1, 2.\n*   The block in column 0 will land on height 2, raising it to 3.\n*   The block in column 1 will land on height 1, raising it to 2. The lower central block will also fill the space below it (this needs careful check).\n*   The block in column 2 will land on height 1, raising it to 2.\n\nLet's re-evaluate placement precisely. A T-piece has its pivot point typically as the center of the crossbar or the center of the middle block of the top row (if inverted).\n\nThe `T_Piece` is typically defined as:\n`[ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,0) ]` where (1,1) is the pivot for initial rotation.\nVisual:\n`.#.`\n`###`\n\nIf rotated `ROTATE_RIGHT` once (90 degrees clockwise):\n`#..`\n`##.`\n`#..`\nPivot (1,1) becomes (1,1). The block at (0,1) moves to (1,2) *relative to pivot*.\nThe piece would be:\n` (1,2) `\n` (0,1) (1,1) `\n` (1,0) `\nWhich is:\n` .# `\n`## `\n` .# `\nThis configuration is good for tucking into corners but not for flattening.\n\nIf rotated `ROTATE_RIGHT` twice (180 degrees clockwise):\n`###`\n`.#.`\nPivot (1,1) remains (1,1).\nThe piece would be:\n` (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) `\n` (1,0) `\nThis is the inverted T-piece. This is what we need.\n\nTo place this inverted T-piece `###` / `.#.` to level `[2, 1, 1]`:\nWe want the `###` part to cover column 0, 1, 2.\nThe `.#.` part will fall into column 1.\n*   The block in column 0 of the `###` lands on height 2.\n*   The block in column 1 of the `###` lands on height 1.\n*   The block in column 2 of the `###` lands on height 1.\n*   The extra block below, in column 1, will land on height 0. This fills the hole at (1,0).\n\nSo, if we place the `###` part with its left-most block at column 0:\nOriginal heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece rotated 180 degrees `(### / .#.)`\n*   Block at (col 0, current_height+1) = (0, 3)\n*   Block at (col 1, current_height+1) = (1, 2)\n*   Block at (col 2, current_height+1) = (2, 2)\n*   Additional block at (col 1, current_height) = (1, 1)\n\nThis means:\n*   Column 0 new height: 2 + 1 = 3\n*   Column 1 new height: 1 (original) + 1 (from ###) + 1 (from .#.) = 3\n*   Column 2 new height: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nResulting board: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThis is not flattening, it's making column 0 and 1 higher than 2.\n\nMy understanding of the T-piece and board interaction might be off.\nLet's assume the blocks always land on the highest point under them.\nIf T-piece `###` / ` .#. ` is placed with its leftmost block at col 0, and its horizontal bar at the height where it can settle:\n*   The block at (0,H) will rest on current height `C[0] = 2`. New height `C[0] + 1`.\n*   The block at (1,H) will rest on current height `C[1] = 1`. New height `C[1] + 1`.\n*   The block at (2,H) will rest on current height `C[2] = 1`. New height `C[2] + 1`.\n*   The block at (1,H-1) (the lower middle block) will fall into the empty space. It would reach height `C[1]`.\n\nSo, the piece `XXX` (top row) will attempt to land such that the lowest point it can go is determined by `max(C[0], C[1], C[2]) - 1` *if the central block fills a gap*.\n\nLet's assume the T-piece `XXX` / ` X ` (180-degree rotation) is placed such that its three top blocks cover columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe block in column 0 will sit on `C[0]=2`.\nThe block in column 1 will sit on `C[1]=1`.\nThe block in column 2 will sit on `C[2]=1`.\n\nThe lowest point this T-piece can drop is when its horizontal bar is at height 1 (since C[1] and C[2] are 1).\nSo, `Y=1` for the `XXX` bar.\nBlock at (0,1) -> (0,2) (existing block already there) -> This implies a block on top of (0,2), making it (0,3).\nBlock at (1,1) -> (1,2) (existing block at (1,1)) -> This implies a block on top of (1,1), making it (1,2).\nBlock at (2,1) -> (2,2) (existing block at (2,1)) -> This implies a block on top of (2,1), making it (2,2).\nThe `X` below the middle block will occupy (1,1), but (1,1) is already occupied by the `XXX`'s middle block if it lands there.\n\nThis implies my understanding of how pieces fall and occupy space is too simplistic. The height calculation needs to consider the minimum height of the piece over the columns it occupies.\n\nLet's use a simpler method: visualize the piece at its lowest possible resting spot for each rotation and horizontal position.\n\n**Current Board:**\n```\n  X . . . . . . . .\n  X . . . . . . . .\n  .

New `C[2]=2`.\n        Result: `[2, 4, 2, ...]`. Also bad.\n\n*   **Rotated 180 degrees clockwise (twice `ROTATE_RIGHT` or once `ROTATE_LEFT`):**\n    `###`\n    ` .#. `\n    This piece is 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks tall.\n    *   **Position 1 (left-most block in column 0):** (Piece occupies columns 0, 1, 2)\n        ```\n        # # #   <-- Y=current_piece_Y+1\n        . # .   <-- Y=current_piece_Y\n        ```\n        The `###` part needs to be placed at the highest point needed to avoid creating a hole.\n        The lowest point it can rest at:\n        *   Column 0 block on C[0]=2.\n        *   Column 1 block on C[1]=1.\n        *   Column 2 block on C[2]=1.\n        The T-piece will sink until its lowest block in any column hits a filled cell.\n        The `.#.` portion is the lowest. If it aligns in col 1, it will hit C[1]=1.\n        So the `.X.` of `.#.` will align with (1,1).\n        This means the `###` part will be at Y=2.\n        *   Block (0,2) rests on board (0,1) -> No, `C[0]` is 2. So it would land at height 2.\n        This calculation is tricky without explicit landing logic.\n\nLet's simplify. To flatten `[2, 1, 1]` to `[2, 2, 2]`, we need to fill the gaps at `(1,0)` and `(2,0)`.\nA `T_Piece` inverted (`###` over `.#.`) is ideal for filling a single gap.\nIf we orient the T-piece as `###` / ` .#. ` (180-degree rotation):\nAnd position it so the `###` covers columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe central `X` of ` .#. ` is in column 1.\nIt will try to drop.\n*   The block at (0, Y_base) would align with (0,2).\n*   The block at (1, Y_base) would align with (1,1).\n*   The block at (2, Y_base) would align with (2,1).\nThe `X` at (1, Y_base - 1) would align with (1,0).\n\nSo, the piece will drop until the `X` at (1, Y_base - 1) hits (1,0).\nThis means `Y_base - 1 = 0`, so `Y_base = 1`.\nThus, the `###` part of the T-piece would be at height 1.\n*   Block at (0,1) would land. But `C[0]=2`. So this cannot happen. The piece would be blocked by `C[0]=2`.\n\nThis means the piece must land on top of the highest point it covers.\nThe highest point covered is `C[0]=2`. So the lowest part of the T-piece that touches column 0 must land at height 2.\nIf the T-piece is `###` / ` .#. `, and its base `###` covers 0,1,2:\nThe block at (0, Y_base) lands at C[0]=2. So `Y_base` must be 2.\nThen the `###` blocks are at `(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)`.\nAnd the `.#.` block is at `(1,1)`.\n\nNew heights:\n*   Column 0: `C[0]=2` (original) + 1 (from T at (0,2)) = 3.\n*   Column 1: `C[1]=1` (original) + 1 (from T at (1,2)) + 1 (from T at (1,1)) = 3.\n*   Column 2: `C[2]=1` (original) + 1 (from T at (2,2)) = 2.\nResult: `[3, 3, 2, ...]` This is consistently bad.\n\nLet's try a different rotation for the T_piece.\nWhat if we place the T_Piece in its initial rotation (` .#. ` / `###`), but move it to the right?\nCurrent heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece:\n```\n  X\nXXX\n```\n*   **Position 1 (left-most `X` at Col 0):** `[3, 3, 2, ...]` (calculated above)\n\n*   **Position 2 (left-most `X` at Col 1):** (occupies columns 1, 2, 3)\n    `C[1]=1, C[2]=1, C[3]=0`\n    The lowest point of the `###` part will be determined by `C[1]=1`.\n    *   Block (1,Y) lands on `C[1]=1`.

New `C[3]=2`.\n    Result: `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, ...]` This still leaves `C[1]=1` and `C[0]=2` and creates `C[2]=2, C[3]=2, C[4]=1`. Not ideal for flattening the left side.\n\n**The initial goal:** flatten `[2, 1, 1]` to `[2, 2, 2]`.\nThis means we need to add 1 block to C1 and 1 block to C2.\nA T-piece always adds 4 blocks.\nThe ideal configuration would be to fill (1,1) and (2,1) without adding to (0,2).\n\nLet's look at the \"hole\" at (1,0) and (2,0).\nWe have `C[0]=2, C[1]=1, C[2]=1`.\nWe need to cover (1,1) and (2,1) and preferably not add to C0 or make it significantly higher.\n\nConsider the T-piece rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise `ROTATE_LEFT` from initial):\n` .# `\n`## `\n` .# `\nThis is also 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall.\n*   **Position 1 (left-most `X` at Col 0):** (occupies 0, 1)\n    ```\n    . # .\n    # # .\n    . # .\n    ```\n    *   Block (0,Y+1) lands on `C[0]=2`.

New `C[1]=4`.\n    Result: `[3, 4, 1, ...]`. Bad.\n\nIt seems difficult to achieve `[2, 2, 2]` with a T-piece from this state.\nThe T-piece is inherently asymmetrical for this specific leveling task.\n\nWhat if we aim for `[3, 2, 2]`? This is the best we could get from the 180-degree rotation starting at col 0, as calculated before:\n`[3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThis state is achieved by:\n1.  Rotate `T_Piece` 180 degrees (e.g., `ROTATE_RIGHT` twice).\n2.  Move `T_Piece` to column 0.\n3.  Hard drop.\n\nLet's re-verify the `[3, 2, 2]` calculation.\nBoard state: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece: `###` / ` .#. `\nPosition it such that the leftmost `X` of the `###` is in column 0.\nThe pieces' coordinates relative to its bounding box bottom-left (0,0) (when rotated 180 degrees) are typically:\n`(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)` for the `###` row.\n`(1,0)` for the `.#.` block.\n\nWhen placed on the board, it will settle.\nThe `(1,0)` block will try to go to the lowest possible y-coordinate in column 1. The lowest point in column 1 is `C[1]=1`. So `(1,0)` wants to go to `(1,1)`.\nThis means the piece's local y=0 maps to global y=1.\nSo the piece's local y=1 maps to global y=2.\nThe blocks will be:\n`(0,2)`\n`(1,2)`\n`(2,2)`\n`(1,1)`\n\nLet's check current board:\n`Board[0]=2`\n`Board[1]=1`\n`Board[2]=1`\n\nNew heights:\n*   At `(0,2)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[0]=2`. New `C[0]=3`.\n*   At `(1,1)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[1]=1`. This fills `(1,1)`. `C[1]` becomes 2.\n*   At `(1,2)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[1]=2`. New `C[1]=3`.\n*   At `(2,2)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[2]=1`. New `C[2]=2`.\n\nThis results in: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nThis is not good. My manual block placement is difficult to do accurately without a simulator.\nLet's consider the \"holes\" in a more general sense.\nThe holes are at (1,0) and (2,0).\nWe have `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nWhat if we place the T-piece *into* the small 'valley'?\nThe valley is at columns 1 and 2, both at height 1. Column 0 is at height 2.\nWe could place the T-piece such that its central block goes into column 1, and its two arms extend to columns 0 and 2.\nThis implies using the standard T-piece rotation (`.#./###`).\nIf we try to center it such that its middle block (the 'X' from '.#.') aligns with column 1.\nThe `###` part of the T-piece would span `[0,1,2]`.\nThe lowest point it can drop is when the `###` part is at height 1.\n*   Block at (0,1) cannot land since `C[0]=2`.\nSo this won't work. The piece is always blocked by the highest point below it.\n\nThe piece will land such that the *minimum* y-coordinate among all its blocks in their respective columns is *one unit higher* than the *maximum* current height among the columns covered by those blocks.\nLet `Piece_Shape(x_offset, y_offset)` be the relative coordinates of the active piece's blocks.\nLet `Column_Heights` be the current board heights.\nThe final landing `Y` for the piece is `max(Column_Heights[col] - y_offset_of_piece_block_in_col) + 1` for all `(col, y_offset_of_piece_block_in_col)` that form the bottom of the piece.\n\nThis is getting too complex for a single thought. Let's simplify the strategy:\n1.  **Prioritize flattening the board if possible.**\n2.  **Avoid creating new holes.**\n3.  **Keep height low.**\n\nGiven `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and a `T_Piece`.\nIf we want to create `[2, 2, 2, 0, ...]`\nWe need to add one block to `C[1]` and one block to `C[2]`.\nA T-piece adds 4 blocks.\n\nThe most intuitive way to flatten `[2,1,1]` is to place an 'L' or 'J' piece to fill the corner.\nSince we have a T-piece, it's harder.\n\nLet's try to make a flat surface.\nConsider placing the T-piece over columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe T-piece in its initial orientation:\n```\n  #\n###\n```\nIf we try to place this over `[2, 1, 1]`.\nThe `#` block is in the center column (column 1). The `###` spans (0,1,2).\nThe piece will drop until its lowest points rest.\nThe lowest point for the block in col 0 is `C[0]=2`.\nThe lowest point for the block in col 1 is `C[1]=1`.\nThe lowest point for the block in col 2 is `C[2]=1`.\n\nThis means the piece will land at `Y=max(C[0]+y_offset_for_0, C[1]+y_offset_for_1, C[2]+y_offset_for_2)`.\nAssuming the T-piece is `(0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(1,0)` (relative to its own bounding box for calculation).\nWhen it drops, its lowest points (those with relative y=0) are in column 1.\nThe block at `(1,0)` will attempt to land at `C[1]=1`. This means the piece's relative y=0 aligns with global y=1.\nThen the blocks at relative y=1 will align with global y=2.\n*   Block at `(0,1)` (global `(0,2)`) will land on `C[0]=2`. So `C[0]` becomes 3.\n*   Block at `(1,1)` (global `(1,2)`) will land on `C[1]=1` (via `(1,0)` block). So `C[1]` becomes 3 (1+1 from `(1,0)` +1 from `(1,1)`).\n*   Block at `(2,1)` (global `(2,2)`) will land on `C[2]=1`. So `C[2]` becomes 2.\nResult: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Still this. This is not a good move.\n\nLet's look for a flat place to drop the T-piece where it doesn't create holes or significant spikes.\nThe columns `3-9` are all at height 0. This is a very flat, empty area.\nWe can place the T-piece in its default orientation, or rotated, over any of these empty columns.\n\nConsider placing the T-piece in its default orientation `.#./###` in columns 7, 8, 9 (leftmost block at col 7).\n`[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece on `C[7], C[8], C[9]` (all 0).\n*   The `###` part will land at height 0.\n*   The `.#.` part will be at height 1, in `C[8]`.\nNew heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`\nThis creates a small bump on the right side. It doesn't help clear anything, but it doesn't make things worse either in the immediate term, and doesn't create holes. It keeps the main stack low.\n\nAnother option: Rotate the T-piece 90 degrees (vertical T). `.#./##/.#`\nIf placed in columns 7, 8, 9, for example, it will create a 3-high column.\nExample: `C[7]=1, C[8]=3, C[9]=1` or similar.\n\nGiven the current state, and the inability of a T-piece to perfectly flatten `[2,1,1]` without creating `[3,3,2]`, it might be best to defer dealing with the `[2,1,1]` section for a future piece (like an I-piece, L-piece or J-piece) and instead place the T-piece in an open area to keep the board low and flat elsewhere.\n\nThe simplest action is to move the T-piece to the right and drop it.\nIf we move it to the right-most available position, it occupies columns 7, 8, 9.\nLet's use the T-piece default orientation.\nIt would create: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]` if its leftmost block is in column 7.\nThis implies it lands on `C[7]=0, C[8]=0, C[9]=0`.\nThe `###` part lands at y=0, the `#` block is above at y=1 in `C[8]`.\nResult: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.\n\nWhat if we rotate it once (`ROTATE_RIGHT`) to `.#./##/.#` and place it at the rightmost edge?\nBlocks at (col 8,0), (col 8,1), (col 8,2) and (col 9,1).\nThis would make `C[8]=3, C[9]=1`.\nResult: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1]`. This is fine too, creates a flat landing surface for future pieces, and the height difference (2) is manageable.\n\nA `T-spin` is also possible if a piece can be rotated into a 3x3 gap, but no such setup exists.\n\nGiven the board is very low, the primary goal is not to clear lines yet, but to build a flat surface for future clears.\nPlacing the T-piece on the far right is a safe bet.\nDefault orientation (`.#./###`): `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]` (if leftmost at C7)\nRotated 180 degrees (`###/.#.`) : `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` (if leftmost at C7)\nRotated 90/270 degrees (vertical) `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1]` (if center col 8)\n\nThe best outcome in terms of flatness and minimum height increase would be the 180-degree rotation (upside down T-piece) placed at the far right.\nThis would create `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` if we left-align at column 7.\nCoordinates of T-piece (180 deg): (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,0) (relative)\nPlaced such that col 0 (of piece) is col 7 (of board).\nGlobal coordinates:\n(7,1), (8,1), (9,1) for the `###`\n(8,0) for the `.#.`\nAll these positions are `C[x]=0`.\nSo, all will land at y=0 or y=1.\n(8,0) lands at `C[8]=0`.\n(7,1) lands at `C[7]=0`.\n(8,1) lands at `C[8]=1`.\n(9,1) lands at `C[9]=0`.\nNew heights: `C[7]=1, C[8]=2, C[9]=1`. (from the piece: `(7,y0+1),(8,y0+1),(9,y0+1),(8,y0)` if `y0=0`).\nResult `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.\n\nThis means the original T-piece and the 180-degree rotated T-piece create the same `[1,2,1]` shape on a flat board.\nLet's re-verify the shapes:\nT-piece `.#./###`: blocks at (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,0) - (relative to bottom left of 3x2 box if middle block is at (1,0)). Let's use canonical form: center (0,0), then `(-1,0), (1,0), (0,1)`.\nSo for T piece in default orientation: `(-1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (0,1)`.\nThis makes the base `XXX` and the top `#`.\nIf placed centered at C8: blocks at (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (8,1).\nThis results in `C[7]=1, C[8]=2, C[9]=1`.\n\nThis is a good, safe placement. It extends the flat base without creating significant height imbalances.\nTo achieve this, the T-piece needs to move `RIGHT` several times.\nThe initial spawn position for T-piece is typically centered, meaning its pivot is at `(col_width/2 - 1, spawn_height)`. For a 10-column board, this is `(4, spawn_height)`.\nCurrent piece center (pivot) is roughly at column 4.\nTarget is to have its center at column 8.\nSo, from column 4 to column 8, it needs to move 4 steps to the right.\nThe plan would be `RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, HARD_DROP`.\nThe first action is `RIGHT`.\nthought: The current board state is `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The active piece is a `T_Piece`.\n\nMy primary goal is to manage the board height and avoid creating holes, ideally by flattening existing structures. The current board has a small structure on the left (`[2, 1, 1]`) and a large, flat, empty area on the right (`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`).\n\nWhile it would be ideal to flatten the `[2, 1, 1]` structure to `[2, 2, 2]`, the `T_Piece` is not well-suited for this specific task without creating a higher spike. As calculated in the scratchpad, placing a `T_Piece` in various rotations over columns 0-2 tends to result in configurations like `[3, 3, 2]`, `[3, 4, 1]`, or `[5, 2, 1]`, none of which improve flatness or keep the board low efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate strategy is to place the `T_Piece` in the large empty area on the right side of the board. This keeps the overall board height low and maintains a mostly flat base for future pieces.\n\nLet's consider placing the `T_Piece` in its initial orientation (`.#./###`) on the far right.\nThe `T_Piece` will occupy three horizontal columns and two vertical levels. If its leftmost block is placed at column 7, it will cover columns 7, 8, and 9.\nCurrent heights in these columns: `C[7]=0, C[8]=0, C[9]=0`.\nWhen the `T_Piece` lands:\n*   The `###` (bottom row) will land at `y=0`.\n*   The `.#.` (top block) will land at `y=1` in column 8.\nThis will result in new heights: `C[7]=1, C[8]=2, C[9]=1`.\nThe resulting board state will be `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.\nThis is a relatively flat and low addition, which is a good outcome.\n\nThe `T_Piece` typically spawns in the middle of the board, usually with its pivot (center of the `###` crossbar) around column 4 or 5. To place its leftmost block at column 7, its center would need to be at column 8. This means it needs to move multiple steps to the right. Assuming a spawn position around column 4 (e.g., center of `###` at x=4), to move to x=8 requires 4 `RIGHT` moves.\n\nPlacement plan:\n1.  Move `RIGHT` (to shift the piece from its spawn position towards the right).\n2.  Repeat `RIGHT` three more times to reach the desired horizontal position (columns 7, 8, 9).\n3.  `HARD_DROP` to place the piece.\n\nThe immediate action is the first `RIGHT` move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, HARD_DROP\nmove: RIGHT",
    "thought": "The current board state is `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and the active piece is a `T_Piece`.\nA `T_Piece` has four possible rotations. The initial orientation (0 degrees) is a flat bar with a block sticking down from the middle.\n*   **0-degree rotation:** ` .#. ` / `###`\n*   **90-degree rotation (clockwise):** ` #. ` / `##` / ` #. `\n*   **180-degree rotation:** `###` / ` .#. `\n*   **270-degree rotation (clockwise):** ` .# ` / `##` / ` .# `\n\nOur goal is to flatten the existing unevenness `[2, 1, 1, ...]` to `[2, 2, 2, ...]`.\nTo achieve `[2, 2, 2]`, we need to place a block in column 1 and column 2, while not increasing column 0 significantly.\n\nLet's consider possible placements for the `T_Piece`:\n\n1.  **Placement Option 1 (0-degree rotation, ` .#. ` / `###`):**\n    If we place the base `###` starting at column 0, it would cover columns 0, 1, 2. The block sticking up would be in column 1.\n    This means:\n    *   Column 0: 2 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 3\n    *   Column 1: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) + 1 (T-piece top) = 3\n    *   Column 2: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 2\n    Result: `[3, 3, 2, ...]` - This creates new unevenness and increases height more than necessary.\n\n2.  **Placement Option 2 (180-degree rotation, `###` / ` .#. `):**\n    This is the inverted T-piece. If we place the flat top `###` to cover columns 0, 1, 2, the block sticking down would be in column 1.\n    *   Column 0: 2 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 3\n    *   Column 1: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) + 0 (T-piece block in hole) = 2\n    *   Column 2: 1 (existing) + 1 (T-piece) = 2\n    Result: `[3, 2, 2, ...]` - This is better but still leaves a height of 3.\n\n3.  **Placement Option 3 (90-degree or 270-degree rotation - vertical T):**\n    Let's use the 90-degree rotation: ` #. ` / `##` / ` #. `\n    If we place this on the board, the center of the `##` part would go into a hole.\n    *   To place this to cover column 1 and 2, it would have to start at column 1.\n    *   If the vertical part is in column 1, and the horizontal part is in column 1 and 2.\n    *   This is difficult to visualize and fit perfectly to level the existing structure.\n\nThe best way to flatten `[2, 1, 1]` with a `T_Piece` is to rotate it to its \"flat\" orientation (`###` base with a block above, or `###` top with a block below) and place it such that the `###` part sits on columns 0, 1, 2, with the central block going into the hole at column 1.\n\nLet's rethink the standard T-piece rotation and its interaction with the board.\nA standard T-piece looks like:\n```\n  X\nXXX\n```\nIf we rotate it once clockwise (`ROTATE_RIGHT`), it looks like:\n```\nX\nXX\nX\n```\nIf we rotate it again (`ROTATE_RIGHT` twice from initial, or `ROTATE_LEFT` once from initial), it looks like:\n```\nXXX\n  X\n```\nThis is the \"upside down T\". This is the best orientation to fill a gap.\n\nLet's place this `XXX` on columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe T-piece has its center block at (x=0, y=1) assuming the bottom-left of its bounding box is (0,0) in its `XXX` / ` X ` orientation.\nWhen placed on the board:\n*   The `XXX` part will occupy cells `(col, board_height[col])` for col 0, 1, 2.\n*   The `X` below the middle will fall into the hole.\n\nLet's assume the T-piece `XXX` / ` X ` is placed such that its top row (`XXX`) is at height `H`.\nThe lowest block of the T-piece (the `X` in the middle below the `XXX`) will be at height `H-1` in the center column.\n\nCurrent heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nWe want to place the T-piece rotated to `XXX` / ` X ` to level columns 0, 1, 2.\nIf we place the `XXX` part on top of columns 0, 1, 2:\n*   Column 0 is at height 2.\n*   Column 1 is at height 1.\n*   Column 2 is at height 1.\n\nTo level them, we need to bring column 1 and 2 up to 2.\nThe `T_Piece` oriented as `XXX` / ` X ` could be placed such that the `XXX` covers columns 0, 1, 2.\n*   The block in column 0 will land on height 2, raising it to 3.\n*   The block in column 1 will land on height 1, raising it to 2. The lower central block will also fill the space below it (this needs careful check).\n*   The block in column 2 will land on height 1, raising it to 2.\n\nLet's re-evaluate placement precisely. A T-piece has its pivot point typically as the center of the crossbar or the center of the middle block of the top row (if inverted).\n\nThe `T_Piece` is typically defined as:\n`[ (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,0) ]` where (1,1) is the pivot for initial rotation.\nVisual:\n`.#.`\n`###`\n\nIf rotated `ROTATE_RIGHT` once (90 degrees clockwise):\n`#..`\n`##.`\n`#..`\nPivot (1,1) becomes (1,1). The block at (0,1) moves to (1,2) *relative to pivot*.\nThe piece would be:\n` (1,2) `\n` (0,1) (1,1) `\n` (1,0) `\nWhich is:\n` .# `\n`## `\n` .# `\nThis configuration is good for tucking into corners but not for flattening.\n\nIf rotated `ROTATE_RIGHT` twice (180 degrees clockwise):\n`###`\n`.#.`\nPivot (1,1) remains (1,1).\nThe piece would be:\n` (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) `\n` (1,0) `\nThis is the inverted T-piece. This is what we need.\n\nTo place this inverted T-piece `###` / `.#.` to level `[2, 1, 1]`:\nWe want the `###` part to cover column 0, 1, 2.\nThe `.#.` part will fall into column 1.\n*   The block in column 0 of the `###` lands on height 2.\n*   The block in column 1 of the `###` lands on height 1.\n*   The block in column 2 of the `###` lands on height 1.\n*   The extra block below, in column 1, will land on height 0. This fills the hole at (1,0).\n\nSo, if we place the `###` part with its left-most block at column 0:\nOriginal heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece rotated 180 degrees `(### / .#.)`\n*   Block at (col 0, current_height+1) = (0, 3)\n*   Block at (col 1, current_height+1) = (1, 2)\n*   Block at (col 2, current_height+1) = (2, 2)\n*   Additional block at (col 1, current_height) = (1, 1)\n\nThis means:\n*   Column 0 new height: 2 + 1 = 3\n*   Column 1 new height: 1 (original) + 1 (from ###) + 1 (from .#.) = 3\n*   Column 2 new height: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nResulting board: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThis is not flattening, it's making column 0 and 1 higher than 2.\n\nMy understanding of the T-piece and board interaction might be off.\nLet's assume the blocks always land on the highest point under them.\nIf T-piece `###` / ` .#. ` is placed with its leftmost block at col 0, and its horizontal bar at the height where it can settle:\n*   The block at (0,H) will rest on current height `C[0] = 2`. New height `C[0] + 1`.\n*   The block at (1,H) will rest on current height `C[1] = 1`. New height `C[1] + 1`.\n*   The block at (2,H) will rest on current height `C[2] = 1`. New height `C[2] + 1`.\n*   The block at (1,H-1) (the lower middle block) will fall into the empty space. It would reach height `C[1]`.\n\nSo, the piece `XXX` (top row) will attempt to land such that the lowest point it can go is determined by `max(C[0], C[1], C[2]) - 1` *if the central block fills a gap*.\n\nLet's assume the T-piece `XXX` / ` X ` (180-degree rotation) is placed such that its three top blocks cover columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe block in column 0 will sit on `C[0]=2`.\nThe block in column 1 will sit on `C[1]=1`.\nThe block in column 2 will sit on `C[2]=1`.\n\nThe lowest point this T-piece can drop is when its horizontal bar is at height 1 (since C[1] and C[2] are 1).\nSo, `Y=1` for the `XXX` bar.\nBlock at (0,1) -> (0,2) (existing block already there) -> This implies a block on top of (0,2), making it (0,3).\nBlock at (1,1) -> (1,2) (existing block at (1,1)) -> This implies a block on top of (1,1), making it (1,2).\nBlock at (2,1) -> (2,2) (existing block at (2,1)) -> This implies a block on top of (2,1), making it (2,2).\nThe `X` below the middle block will occupy (1,1), but (1,1) is already occupied by the `XXX`'s middle block if it lands there.\n\nThis implies my understanding of how pieces fall and occupy space is too simplistic. The height calculation needs to consider the minimum height of the piece over the columns it occupies.\n\nLet's use a simpler method: visualize the piece at its lowest possible resting spot for each rotation and horizontal position.\n\n**Current Board:**\n```\n  X . . . . . . . .\n  X . . . . . . . .\n  . X X . . . . . .\n```\nHeights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n**Active Piece: T_Piece** (standard orientation, ` .#. ` / `###`)\nThis piece is 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks tall.\n*   **Initial placement (no rotation):**\n    If we place it such that its left-most block is in column 0:\n    ```\n      . # .    <-- at Y=current_piece_Y+1\n    # # #    <-- at Y=current_piece_Y\n    ```\n    The `###` part could land on `[2, 1, 1]`.\n    *   Block (0, Y) lands on `C[0]=2`. New `C[0]=3`.\n    *   Block (1, Y) lands on `C[1]=1`. New `C[1]=2`.\n    *   Block (2, Y) lands on `C[2]=1`. New `C[2]=2`.\n    *   Block (1, Y+1) lands on `C[1]=2`. New `C[1]=3`.\n    Result: `[3, 3, 2, ...]` (still not flat, increases height)\n\n*   **Rotated 90 degrees clockwise (once `ROTATE_RIGHT`):**\n    `#.`\n    `##`\n    `#.`\n    This piece is 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall.\n    *   **Position 1 (left-most block in column 0):**\n        ```\n        # .  <-- at Y=current_piece_Y+2\n        # #  <-- at Y=current_piece_Y+1\n        # .  <-- at Y=current_piece_Y\n        ```\n        *   Block (0, Y) lands on `C[0]=2`. New `C[0]=3`.\n        *   Block (0, Y+1) lands on `C[0]=3`. New `C[0]=4`.\n        *   Block (0, Y+2) lands on `C[0]=4`. New `C[0]=5`.\n        *   Block (1, Y+1) lands on `C[1]=1`. New `C[1]=2`.\n        This would be `[5, 2, 1, ...]`. Terrible.\n    *   **Position 2 (left-most block in column 1):** (Piece starts from column 1, occupies 1,2)\n        ```\n        . # .\n        . # #\n        . # .\n        ```\n        *   Block (1, Y) lands on `C[1]=1`.

New `C[2]=2`.\n        Result: `[2, 4, 2, ...]`. Also bad.\n\n*   **Rotated 180 degrees clockwise (twice `ROTATE_RIGHT` or once `ROTATE_LEFT`):**\n    `###`\n    ` .#. `\n    This piece is 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks tall.\n    *   **Position 1 (left-most block in column 0):** (Piece occupies columns 0, 1, 2)\n        ```\n        # # #   <-- Y=current_piece_Y+1\n        . # .   <-- Y=current_piece_Y\n        ```\n        The `###` part needs to be placed at the highest point needed to avoid creating a hole.\n        The lowest point it can rest at:\n        *   Column 0 block on C[0]=2.\n        *   Column 1 block on C[1]=1.\n        *   Column 2 block on C[2]=1.\n        The T-piece will sink until its lowest block in any column hits a filled cell.\n        The `.#.` portion is the lowest. If it aligns in col 1, it will hit C[1]=1.\n        So the `.X.` of `.#.` will align with (1,1).\n        This means the `###` part will be at Y=2.\n        *   Block (0,2) rests on board (0,1) -> No, `C[0]` is 2. So it would land at height 2.\n        This calculation is tricky without explicit landing logic.\n\nLet's simplify. To flatten `[2, 1, 1]` to `[2, 2, 2]`, we need to fill the gaps at `(1,0)` and `(2,0)`.\nA `T_Piece` inverted (`###` over `.#.`) is ideal for filling a single gap.\nIf we orient the T-piece as `###` / ` .#. ` (180-degree rotation):\nAnd position it so the `###` covers columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe central `X` of ` .#. ` is in column 1.\nIt will try to drop.\n*   The block at (0, Y_base) would align with (0,2).\n*   The block at (1, Y_base) would align with (1,1).\n*   The block at (2, Y_base) would align with (2,1).\nThe `X` at (1, Y_base - 1) would align with (1,0).\n\nSo, the piece will drop until the `X` at (1, Y_base - 1) hits (1,0).\nThis means `Y_base - 1 = 0`, so `Y_base = 1`.\nThus, the `###` part of the T-piece would be at height 1.\n*   Block at (0,1) would land. But `C[0]=2`. So this cannot happen. The piece would be blocked by `C[0]=2`.\n\nThis means the piece must land on top of the highest point it covers.\nThe highest point covered is `C[0]=2`. So the lowest part of the T-piece that touches column 0 must land at height 2.\nIf the T-piece is `###` / ` .#. `, and its base `###` covers 0,1,2:\nThe block at (0, Y_base) lands at C[0]=2. So `Y_base` must be 2.\nThen the `###` blocks are at `(0,2), (1,2), (2,2)`.\nAnd the `.#.` block is at `(1,1)`.\n\nNew heights:\n*   Column 0: `C[0]=2` (original) + 1 (from T at (0,2)) = 3.\n*   Column 1: `C[1]=1` (original) + 1 (from T at (1,2)) + 1 (from T at (1,1)) = 3.\n*   Column 2: `C[2]=1` (original) + 1 (from T at (2,2)) = 2.\nResult: `[3, 3, 2, ...]` This is consistently bad.\n\nLet's try a different rotation for the T_piece.\nWhat if we place the T_Piece in its initial rotation (` .#. ` / `###`), but move it to the right?\nCurrent heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece:\n```\n  X\nXXX\n```\n*   **Position 1 (left-most `X` at Col 0):** `[3, 3, 2, ...]` (calculated above)\n\n*   **Position 2 (left-most `X` at Col 1):** (occupies columns 1, 2, 3)\n    `C[1]=1, C[2]=1, C[3]=0`\n    The lowest point of the `###` part will be determined by `C[1]=1`.\n    *   Block (1,Y) lands on `C[1]=1`. New `C[1]=2`.\n    *   Block (2,Y) lands on `C[2]=1`. New `C[2]=2`.\n    *   Block (3,Y) lands on `C[3]=0`. New `C[3]=1`.\n    *   Block (2,Y+1) lands on `C[2]=2`. New `C[2]=3`.\n    Result: `[2, 2, 3, 1, ...]` (This creates another hole/unevenness)\n\n*   **Position 3 (left-most `X` at Col 2):** (occupies columns 2, 3, 4)\n    `C[2]=1, C[3]=0, C[4]=0`\n    Lowest point for `###` is determined by `C[2]=1`.\n    *   Block (2,Y) lands on `C[2]=1`. New `C[2]=2`.\n    *   Block (3,Y) lands on `C[3]=0`. New `C[3]=1`.\n    *   Block (4,Y) lands on `C[4]=0`. New `C[4]=1`.\n    *   Block (3,Y+1) lands on `C[3]=1`. New `C[3]=2`.\n    Result: `[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, ...]` This still leaves `C[1]=1` and `C[0]=2` and creates `C[2]=2, C[3]=2, C[4]=1`. Not ideal for flattening the left side.\n\n**The initial goal:** flatten `[2, 1, 1]` to `[2, 2, 2]`.\nThis means we need to add 1 block to C1 and 1 block to C2.\nA T-piece always adds 4 blocks.\nThe ideal configuration would be to fill (1,1) and (2,1) without adding to (0,2).\n\nLet's look at the \"hole\" at (1,0) and (2,0).\nWe have `C[0]=2, C[1]=1, C[2]=1`.\nWe need to cover (1,1) and (2,1) and preferably not add to C0 or make it significantly higher.\n\nConsider the T-piece rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise `ROTATE_LEFT` from initial):\n` .# `\n`## `\n` .# `\nThis is also 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall.\n*   **Position 1 (left-most `X` at Col 0):** (occupies 0, 1)\n    ```\n    . # .\n    # # .\n    . # .\n    ```\n    *   Block (0,Y+1) lands on `C[0]=2`. New `C[0]=3`.\n    *   Block (1,Y) lands on `C[1]=1`. New `C[1]=2`.\n    *   Block (1,Y+1) lands on `C[1]=2`. New `C[1]=3`.\n    *   Block (1,Y+2) lands on `C[1]=3`. New `C[1]=4`.\n    Result: `[3, 4, 1, ...]`. Bad.\n\nIt seems difficult to achieve `[2, 2, 2]` with a T-piece from this state.\nThe T-piece is inherently asymmetrical for this specific leveling task.\n\nWhat if we aim for `[3, 2, 2]`? This is the best we could get from the 180-degree rotation starting at col 0, as calculated before:\n`[3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nThis state is achieved by:\n1.  Rotate `T_Piece` 180 degrees (e.g., `ROTATE_RIGHT` twice).\n2.  Move `T_Piece` to column 0.\n3.  Hard drop.\n\nLet's re-verify the `[3, 2, 2]` calculation.\nBoard state: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece: `###` / ` .#. `\nPosition it such that the leftmost `X` of the `###` is in column 0.\nThe pieces' coordinates relative to its bounding box bottom-left (0,0) (when rotated 180 degrees) are typically:\n`(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)` for the `###` row.\n`(1,0)` for the `.#.` block.\n\nWhen placed on the board, it will settle.\nThe `(1,0)` block will try to go to the lowest possible y-coordinate in column 1. The lowest point in column 1 is `C[1]=1`. So `(1,0)` wants to go to `(1,1)`.\nThis means the piece's local y=0 maps to global y=1.\nSo the piece's local y=1 maps to global y=2.\nThe blocks will be:\n`(0,2)`\n`(1,2)`\n`(2,2)`\n`(1,1)`\n\nLet's check current board:\n`Board[0]=2`\n`Board[1]=1`\n`Board[2]=1`\n\nNew heights:\n*   At `(0,2)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[0]=2`. New `C[0]=3`.\n*   At `(1,1)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[1]=1`. This fills `(1,1)`. `C[1]` becomes 2.\n*   At `(1,2)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[1]=2`. New `C[1]=3`.\n*   At `(2,2)`: T-piece `X` lands on `C[2]=1`. New `C[2]=2`.\n\nThis results in: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nThis is not good. My manual block placement is difficult to do accurately without a simulator.\nLet's consider the \"holes\" in a more general sense.\nThe holes are at (1,0) and (2,0).\nWe have `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nWhat if we place the T-piece *into* the small 'valley'?\nThe valley is at columns 1 and 2, both at height 1. Column 0 is at height 2.\nWe could place the T-piece such that its central block goes into column 1, and its two arms extend to columns 0 and 2.\nThis implies using the standard T-piece rotation (`.#./###`).\nIf we try to center it such that its middle block (the 'X' from '.#.') aligns with column 1.\nThe `###` part of the T-piece would span `[0,1,2]`.\nThe lowest point it can drop is when the `###` part is at height 1.\n*   Block at (0,1) cannot land since `C[0]=2`.\nSo this won't work. The piece is always blocked by the highest point below it.\n\nThe piece will land such that the *minimum* y-coordinate among all its blocks in their respective columns is *one unit higher* than the *maximum* current height among the columns covered by those blocks.\nLet `Piece_Shape(x_offset, y_offset)` be the relative coordinates of the active piece's blocks.\nLet `Column_Heights` be the current board heights.\nThe final landing `Y` for the piece is `max(Column_Heights[col] - y_offset_of_piece_block_in_col) + 1` for all `(col, y_offset_of_piece_block_in_col)` that form the bottom of the piece.\n\nThis is getting too complex for a single thought. Let's simplify the strategy:\n1.  **Prioritize flattening the board if possible.**\n2.  **Avoid creating new holes.**\n3.  **Keep height low.**\n\nGiven `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and a `T_Piece`.\nIf we want to create `[2, 2, 2, 0, ...]`\nWe need to add one block to `C[1]` and one block to `C[2]`.\nA T-piece adds 4 blocks.\n\nThe most intuitive way to flatten `[2,1,1]` is to place an 'L' or 'J' piece to fill the corner.\nSince we have a T-piece, it's harder.\n\nLet's try to make a flat surface.\nConsider placing the T-piece over columns 0, 1, 2.\nThe T-piece in its initial orientation:\n```\n  #\n###\n```\nIf we try to place this over `[2, 1, 1]`.\nThe `#` block is in the center column (column 1). The `###` spans (0,1,2).\nThe piece will drop until its lowest points rest.\nThe lowest point for the block in col 0 is `C[0]=2`.\nThe lowest point for the block in col 1 is `C[1]=1`.\nThe lowest point for the block in col 2 is `C[2]=1`.\n\nThis means the piece will land at `Y=max(C[0]+y_offset_for_0, C[1]+y_offset_for_1, C[2]+y_offset_for_2)`.\nAssuming the T-piece is `(0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(1,0)` (relative to its own bounding box for calculation).\nWhen it drops, its lowest points (those with relative y=0) are in column 1.\nThe block at `(1,0)` will attempt to land at `C[1]=1`. This means the piece's relative y=0 aligns with global y=1.\nThen the blocks at relative y=1 will align with global y=2.\n*   Block at `(0,1)` (global `(0,2)`) will land on `C[0]=2`. So `C[0]` becomes 3.\n*   Block at `(1,1)` (global `(1,2)`) will land on `C[1]=1` (via `(1,0)` block). So `C[1]` becomes 3 (1+1 from `(1,0)` +1 from `(1,1)`).\n*   Block at `(2,1)` (global `(2,2)`) will land on `C[2]=1`. So `C[2]` becomes 2.\nResult: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Still this. This is not a good move.\n\nLet's look for a flat place to drop the T-piece where it doesn't create holes or significant spikes.\nThe columns `3-9` are all at height 0. This is a very flat, empty area.\nWe can place the T-piece in its default orientation, or rotated, over any of these empty columns.\n\nConsider placing the T-piece in its default orientation `.#./###` in columns 7, 8, 9 (leftmost block at col 7).\n`[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\nT-piece on `C[7], C[8], C[9]` (all 0).\n*   The `###` part will land at height 0.\n*   The `.#.` part will be at height 1, in `C[8]`.\nNew heights: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`\nThis creates a small bump on the right side. It doesn't help clear anything, but it doesn't make things worse either in the immediate term, and doesn't create holes. It keeps the main stack low.\n\nAnother option: Rotate the T-piece 90 degrees (vertical T). `.#./##/.#`\nIf placed in columns 7, 8, 9, for example, it will create a 3-high column.\nExample: `C[7]=1, C[8]=3, C[9]=1` or similar.\n\nGiven the current state, and the inability of a T-piece to perfectly flatten `[2,1,1]` without creating `[3,3,2]`, it might be best to defer dealing with the `[2,1,1]` section for a future piece (like an I-piece, L-piece or J-piece) and instead place the T-piece in an open area to keep the board low and flat elsewhere.\n\nThe simplest action is to move the T-piece to the right and drop it.\nIf we move it to the right-most available position, it occupies columns 7, 8, 9.\nLet's use the T-piece default orientation.\nIt would create: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]` if its leftmost block is in column 7.\nThis implies it lands on `C[7]=0, C[8]=0, C[9]=0`.\nThe `###` part lands at y=0, the `#` block is above at y=1 in `C[8]`.\nResult: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.\n\nWhat if we rotate it once (`ROTATE_RIGHT`) to `.#./##/.#` and place it at the rightmost edge?\nBlocks at (col 8,0), (col 8,1), (col 8,2) and (col 9,1).\nThis would make `C[8]=3, C[9]=1`.\nResult: `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1]`. This is fine too, creates a flat landing surface for future pieces, and the height difference (2) is manageable.\n\nA `T-spin` is also possible if a piece can be rotated into a 3x3 gap, but no such setup exists.\n\nGiven the board is very low, the primary goal is not to clear lines yet, but to build a flat surface for future clears.\nPlacing the T-piece on the far right is a safe bet.\nDefault orientation (`.#./###`): `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]` (if leftmost at C7)\nRotated 180 degrees (`###/.#.`) : `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` (if leftmost at C7)\nRotated 90/270 degrees (vertical) `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1]` (if center col 8)\n\nThe best outcome in terms of flatness and minimum height increase would be the 180-degree rotation (upside down T-piece) placed at the far right.\nThis would create `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` if we left-align at column 7.\nCoordinates of T-piece (180 deg): (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,0) (relative)\nPlaced such that col 0 (of piece) is col 7 (of board).\nGlobal coordinates:\n(7,1), (8,1), (9,1) for the `###`\n(8,0) for the `.#.`\nAll these positions are `C[x]=0`.\nSo, all will land at y=0 or y=1.\n(8,0) lands at `C[8]=0`.\n(7,1) lands at `C[7]=0`.\n(8,1) lands at `C[8]=1`.\n(9,1) lands at `C[9]=0`.\nNew heights: `C[7]=1, C[8]=2, C[9]=1`. (from the piece: `(7,y0+1),(8,y0+1),(9,y0+1),(8,y0)` if `y0=0`).\nResult `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.\n\nThis means the original T-piece and the 180-degree rotated T-piece create the same `[1,2,1]` shape on a flat board.\nLet's re-verify the shapes:\nT-piece `.#./###`: blocks at (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,0) - (relative to bottom left of 3x2 box if middle block is at (1,0)). Let's use canonical form: center (0,0), then `(-1,0), (1,0), (0,1)`.\nSo for T piece in default orientation: `(-1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (0,1)`.\nThis makes the base `XXX` and the top `#`.\nIf placed centered at C8: blocks at (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (8,1).\nThis results in `C[7]=1, C[8]=2, C[9]=1`.\n\nThis is a good, safe placement. It extends the flat base without creating significant height imbalances.\nTo achieve this, the T-piece needs to move `RIGHT` several times.\nThe initial spawn position for T-piece is typically centered, meaning its pivot is at `(col_width/2 - 1, spawn_height)`. For a 10-column board, this is `(4, spawn_height)`.\nCurrent piece center (pivot) is roughly at column 4.\nTarget is to have its center at column 8.\nSo, from column 4 to column 8, it needs to move 4 steps to the right.\nThe plan would be `RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, HARD_DROP`.\nThe first action is `RIGHT`.\nthought: The current board state is `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The active piece is a `T_Piece`.\n\nMy primary goal is to manage the board height and avoid creating holes, ideally by flattening existing structures. The current board has a small structure on the left (`[2, 1, 1]`) and a large, flat, empty area on the right (`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`).\n\nWhile it would be ideal to flatten the `[2, 1, 1]` structure to `[2, 2, 2]`, the `T_Piece` is not well-suited for this specific task without creating a higher spike. As calculated in the scratchpad, placing a `T_Piece` in various rotations over columns 0-2 tends to result in configurations like `[3, 3, 2]`, `[3, 4, 1]`, or `[5, 2, 1]`, none of which improve flatness or keep the board low efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate strategy is to place the `T_Piece` in the large empty area on the right side of the board. This keeps the overall board height low and maintains a mostly flat base for future pieces.\n\nLet's consider placing the `T_Piece` in its initial orientation (`.#./###`) on the far right.\nThe `T_Piece` will occupy three horizontal columns and two vertical levels. If its leftmost block is placed at column 7, it will cover columns 7, 8, and 9.\nCurrent heights in these columns: `C[7]=0, C[8]=0, C[9]=0`.\nWhen the `T_Piece` lands:\n*   The `###` (bottom row) will land at `y=0`.\n*   The `.#.` (top block) will land at `y=1` in column 8.\nThis will result in new heights: `C[7]=1, C[8]=2, C[9]=1`.\nThe resulting board state will be `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.\nThis is a relatively flat and low addition, which is a good outcome.\n\nThe `T_Piece` typically spawns in the middle of the board, usually with its pivot (center of the `###` crossbar) around column 4 or 5. To place its leftmost block at column 7, its center would need to be at column 8. This means it needs to move multiple steps to the right. Assuming a spawn position around column 4 (e.g., center of `###` at x=4), to move to x=8 requires 4 `RIGHT` moves.\n\nPlacement plan:\n1.  Move `RIGHT` (to shift the piece from its spawn position towards the right).\n2.  Repeat `RIGHT` three more times to reach the desired horizontal position (columns 7, 8, 9).\n3.  `HARD_DROP` to place the piece.\n\nThe immediate action is the first `RIGHT` move.\n\nPlacement_Plan: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, HARD_DROP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context available, so I cannot assess how the board has changed or if previous strategies were effective.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, this cannot be evaluated.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is severely imbalanced. Columns 0-3 are at height 3, while columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a deep and wide 'well' on the right side of the board. The immediate priority is to start building a base in this empty space (columns C4-C9) to level the board and create potential for line clears. The current height of 3 on the left is not immediately threatening.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an S-piece. This piece naturally creates zig-zag patterns and is not ideal for flattening a wide open space or building a perfectly level base. However, it's the only available piece.\n\n    *   **Goal:** Begin to fill the empty columns (C4-C9) and reduce the extreme height differential.\n    *   **S-Piece Placement:** The most effective use of the S-piece in this situation would be to place it in an orientation that creates the flattest possible surface on the empty side, preferably starting from column C4.\n        *   The default S-piece orientation (`.SS / SS.`) would result in an uneven base (e.g., `[..., 1, 2, 1, ...]`).\n        *   Rotating the S-piece 90 degrees clockwise (`S. / SS / .S`) and placing it such that its leftmost block is in C4 would result in columns C4 and C5 reaching height 2, and C6 remaining at height 0 (or C5 and C6 at height 2 if shifted one more to the right, depending on exact block configuration). Specifically, landing the rotated S-piece with its \"lowest\" blocks at C4 and C5 would build up C4 to height 2 and C5 to height 2, leaving C6 at height 0. This creates a solid 2x2 block structure which is a good starting point for building a flat surface.\n    *   **Overall Strategy:** Given the piece, focus on creating a stable, though potentially small, foundation on the right side, aiming to gradually extend and level it with subsequent pieces. Avoid creating new holes on the left side while addressing the right.\n\n**Action:**\nTo achieve the most stable initial base on the right using the S-piece, I will rotate it clockwise and then hard drop it to align the resulting 2x2 base over C4 and C5.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate changes. However, the current board state shows a significant disparity: columns 0-3 are partially filled with heights `[5, 5, 3, 3]`, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This creates a deep \"canyon\" or well between column 3 and column 4.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the effectiveness of a last move or thought process is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the large gap created by the empty columns 4-9. Specifically, the sharp drop-off from column 3 (height 3) to column 4 (height 0) is a critical point. Additionally, columns 0 and 1 are relatively high at height 5, indicating a need to prepare for future line clears involving these columns.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current goal should be to begin leveling the board and prepare for line clears, particularly by addressing the deep well on the right. The active `J_Piece` can be strategically placed to bridge the gap between the existing structure and the empty right side, or to start building up the right side gradually. Placing the `J_Piece` to connect column 3 with column 4, while potentially increasing heights on the left slightly, would be a reasonable first step towards a flatter board profile. This move prioritizes building out the board and reducing significant height differences over an immediate line clear, which is not readily available with the J-piece in this configuration.\n\n**Reasoning for Action:**\nThe most strategic use of the `J_Piece` in this state is to bridge the large gap between the existing blocks and the empty right side of the board. By rotating the `J_Piece` right once (`[#., #., ##]`) and shifting it left once, it can be placed such that its bottom-right block sits on column 3, its bottom-left block on column 4, and the two blocks above them on column 3 and column 2, respectively. This would result in column heights becoming approximately `[5, 5, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This action strategically extends the board to the right, mitigating the severe height drop-off, and creates a more contiguous base for future pieces without creating new holes. While it doesn't clear any lines immediately, it's a critical step in setting up a more manageable and buildable board.\n\n**Action:**\nROTATE_RIGHT",

The goal is to level the board and prepare for future line clears, which means bridging the gap to the right.\n\nLet's analyze the J_Piece rotations and placements:\n\nThe standard J_Piece in its initial orientation (0 degrees) is typically represented as:\n```\n# .\n# .\n# #\n```\n(height 3, width 2, hook on bottom right relative to vertical bar)\n\nIf we rotate the J_Piece 90 degrees clockwise (ROTATE_RIGHT), it becomes:\n```\n  #\n###\n```\n(height 2, width 3, a horizontal bar with a block hanging above its left end).\nLet's refer to this as `J_rot_1`.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **Board Changes:** As there's no previous context, I cannot track changes. The current board shows a significant height disparity: the left side (columns 0-2) is high (7, 7, 6), while the right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty. Column 3 is at height 3, acting as a transition. This creates a very deep, wide well on the right.\n\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Unknown, as no previous moves were provided. However, the current state strongly suggests either a deliberate setup for a large line clear (e.g., Tetris) using the deep well, or a series of suboptimal placements that led to this extreme unevenness.\n\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:**\n    *   **Right-side well (Columns 4-9):** This is the primary feature. It needs to be filled efficiently, ideally with an I-piece for a Tetris, or carefully layered to level the board.\n    *   **Left-side peaks (Columns 0-2):** These high columns need to be brought down to reduce overall board height and flatness.\n    *   **Mid-board (Column 3):** This column is relatively isolated and needs integration into the general leveling strategy.\n\n4.  **Strategic Insights:**\n    *   **Prioritize Tetris Setup:** The board is perfectly sculpted for a Tetris line clear if an I-piece becomes available. This should be the immediate goal if future pieces allow.\n    *   **Leveling:** If an I-piece isn't forthcoming, the strategy must shift to carefully filling the right-side well (columns 4-9) while simultaneously trying to clear lines on the left (columns 0-2) to reduce the substantial height differences and improve overall flatness.\n    *   **Avoid new holes:** With the current height, new holes on the left side would be disastrous.\n    *   **Critical missing information:** The active piece is UNKNOWN. This is paramount for tactical decision-making. Future moves are highly dependent on the shape of the next piece.",

The primary area of concern is the high and uneven left side, particularly the trench in C3, which could become a problematic hole if not managed.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate strategic priority is to level out the board and reduce overall height. The open space from C4-C9 offers a great opportunity for clean builds and line clears. Efforts should be made to:\n    *   Fill the deep well in C3 to prevent it from becoming a permanent hole or an unfillable gap.\n    *   Build deliberately in the C4-C9 area, aiming for flat surfaces to maximize future line clear potential.\n    *   Avoid further increasing the height of C0-C2 or creating new holes on the left side.\n    *   Without knowing the active piece, general advice is to prioritize pieces that can either bridge the gap in C3 or contribute to a flat base for the wide open right side.",

This is the most urgent area requiring attention, as leaving it unfilled will severely limit future placement options and increase the risk of topping out.\n    *   **High and Uneven Left Side (C0-C2)**: Columns 0, 1, and 2 are relatively high and uneven (10, 10, 11). While the hole in C3 is more immediate, these high columns contribute to overall board height and will need to be addressed by clearing lines.\n    *   **Massive Open Right Side (C4-C9)**: Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty. This provides a large, flexible area for building but also demands careful management to avoid creating new unfillable holes or leaving a large, deep trench.\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling Column 3**: The immediate strategic priority is to use upcoming pieces to fill the deep well in Column 3. Look for pieces (L, J, T, S, Z, O) that can be rotated and maneuvered into this space.\n    *   **Utilize the open right side strategically**: The empty C4-C9 area offers flexibility. It can be used to set up a clean, low base, or to create a \"well\" for I-pieces to clear multiple lines if the left side gets too high. However, avoid indiscriminately dropping pieces here without a plan to maintain flatness.\n    *   **Prepare for line clears on the left**: Once Column 3 is managed, focus on clearing lines involving the high columns (C0-C2) to reduce the overall board height and increase available space.\n    *   **Active piece unknown**: Without knowledge of the active piece, specific placement strategies are impossible.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, a direct comparison is not possible. However, the current board state shows a significant disparity: columns 0, 1, and 2 are very high (13, 14, 14), while column 3 has a deep well (height 3). The remaining columns (4-9) are completely empty. This indicates a highly imbalanced board with a critical hole.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of the last active piece, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is **Column 3**, which is a deep well (height 3) surrounded by much higher blocks. This needs immediate attention to prevent future blockages and maintain potential for line clears. The overall **left side (C0-C2)** is very high, suggesting a need for eventual line clears to reduce the overall height. The **right side (C4-C9)** is completely empty, offering significant potential for piece placement and Tetris setups if an I-piece becomes available.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal should be to **fill the well in Column 3**. Depending on the next piece (which is currently unknown), prioritize dropping pieces that can effectively bridge the gap from C2 (height 14) to C3 (height 3) or directly fill C3. If an I-piece appears, it would be ideal for this well, or for setting up a Tetris clear on the wide-open right side. General strategy should focus on **flattening the board** by clearing lines, especially on the high left side, and utilizing the extensive empty space on the right for maneuverability and setup. Avoid creating new holes near the existing high structures.",
    "response": "thought: The most critical piece of information, the `Active Piece`, is listed as `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the type of the active Tetromino, it is impossible to formulate an optimal or even a sensible placement plan. Any rotational or horizontal movement would be a blind guess and could lead to a suboptimal or even detrimental placement. The board is not in an immediate game-over state (max height 14), so there is no urgent need to hard drop. The safest action in this situation is `NO_OP`, which allows the piece to fall by one unit without any horizontal or rotational manipulation.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous states are provided, I can only analyze the current observation. The board currently presents an extreme imbalance: columns 0-3 are nearly full (height 15), while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This indicates a significant build-up on the left side of the board without corresponding line clears.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without context on the last move or thought process, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness directly. However, the resulting board state, with columns 0-3 at height 15 and the remaining columns empty, is highly critical and suggests that recent actions have led to an extremely difficult situation, nearing a game over.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The entire board requires immediate attention due to the high stack. Specifically:\n    *   **Columns 0-3:** These columns are critically high, demanding urgent line clears to avoid topping out.\n    *   **Columns 4-9:** This vast empty space is both the primary problem (as it's creating the height disparity) and the primary opportunity to build a base for line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current state is critical and requires immediate survival-focused actions:\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears:** With the left side at height 15, the absolute top priority is to clear lines as quickly as possible to reduce the overall board height.\n    *   **Focus on the Right Well:** All efforts must be directed towards building up columns 4-9 to create horizontal lines that can clear across the entire width.\n    *   **Horizontal Building:** Place pieces to span the empty right-side columns, aiming to create a flat surface at a lower height to set up for multi-line clears.\n    *   **Avoid Left-Side Additions:** Do not add any further height to columns 0-3 unless it directly results in an immediate line clear that significantly improves the board state.\n    *   **Seek I-Pieces:** An I-piece would be invaluable for quickly bridging the gap on the right and clearing a line.",
    "response": "thought: The current game state is extremely critical. Columns 0-3 are at height 15, very close to topping out, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This indicates a severe imbalance and an urgent need to clear lines. However, the active piece is listed as UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal or even a sensible placement plan involving rotations or specific lateral movements. Making a blind move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) or immediately dropping (SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) an unknown piece carries an extremely high risk of misplacing it in a way that worsens the already dire board state, potentially leading to an immediate game over. Therefore, the only logical and risk-minimizing action in this situation is to perform a NO_OP. This action will allow the game to advance one frame, hopefully revealing the identity of the active piece in the next observation, at which point a proper strategy can be developed to address the critical board layout.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Previous context is unavailable, so I cannot assess how the board has changed or what the history of moves has been.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the effectiveness of the last move or the reasoning behind it is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a critically imbalanced state.\n    *   **Immediate Danger Zone (C0-C3):** Columns C0, C1, C2, and C3 are very high (16, 17, 17, 15 respectively). Column 1 and 2 are only 3 blocks away from topping out (max height 20). This area demands extreme caution to avoid creating new holes or increasing height further without clearing lines.\n    *   **Opportunity Zone (C4-C9):** Columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This vast empty space presents a significant opportunity for efficient line clears and score generation, but also needs to be built up strategically to balance the board.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Survival is paramount:** Given the high columns on the left, the primary goal for the next few moves must be to survive. Avoid topping out on C1 or C2.\n    *   **Balance the board:** The long-term strategy involves gradually filling the empty columns (C4-C9) to even out the board's height profile. This will create more maneuverability and reduce the risk of a sudden game over.\n    *   **Line clearing:** Prioritize clearing lines, especially from the high left side, to reduce the overall stack height. An 'I' piece would be incredibly valuable if it could be dropped into the right-side well to clear multiple lines across the entire board.\n    *   **Avoid new holes:** Do not create any new holes under the high blocks on the left (C0-C3), as these would be difficult to fill and exacerbate the critical state.\n    *   **Critical Information Gap:** The most significant strategic limitation is that the `Active Piece` is `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the shape of the current falling piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal move.\n\n**Reasoning for Action Selection (given UNKNOWN active piece):**\n\nThe `Active Piece` being `UNKNOWN` makes selecting a truly informed action impossible. Any choice is a gamble. However, the prompt requires an action.\nGiven the critical height on the left side (C0-C3) and the completely empty right side (C4-C9), committing to a `HARD_DROP` or `SOFT_DROP` without knowing the piece shape is extremely risky; it could lead to an immediate game over if the piece is tall and lands poorly on the high side. Rotating is also meaningless without knowing the piece.\n\nTherefore, the safest *initial* action, if forced to choose and assuming the piece spawns centrally, is to move it away from the immediate danger zone and towards the vast open space, allowing more room for evaluation once the piece type becomes known (which is an assumption about future game revelation not in the current observation). Moving `RIGHT` pushes the piece towards columns C4-C9. This does not commit to a placement but shifts its horizontal position, hopefully into a less immediately threatening area.\n\n**Action:**\nRIGHT",

The most significant problem is that the `Active Piece` is `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the shape of the piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan. Placing a piece blindly could lead to an immediate game over if it lands poorly on the high left side.\n\nGiven the extreme uncertainty, the safest initial action is to move the piece away from the immediate danger zone on the left and towards the vast open space on the right. This does not commit to a final placement but provides more horizontal maneuvering room for when the piece shape eventually becomes known. Moving `RIGHT` is the only action that fulfills this defensive strategy in the absence of information. Any rotation or soft/hard drop would be irresponsible without knowing the piece shape.\n\nSince I cannot formulate a full plan without knowing the piece, the \"Placement_Plan\" will reflect the single, immediate, defensive action chosen.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: RIGHT",

    "reflection": "The board is in a critical state. The left side (columns 0-3) is extremely high, with columns 0 and 1 almost topping out at height 19. This indicates significant pressure on that side of the board. Conversely, columns 4-9 are completely empty, creating a vast open well on the right.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    I lack previous context to directly compare board states. However, the current state implies a recent, drastic change: either a massive line clear on the right side, or a consistent strategy of building high on the left while keeping the right side clear. The stark contrast between the high left wall and the empty right half is the most prominent feature.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context or knowledge of the last move or thought process, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Immediate attention is required for columns 0 and 1, which are at height 19. Any piece placed there without a line clear will result in a game over. The entire left wall (C0-C3) needs to be brought down. The dip at C3 (height 15) also represents a potential hole if not managed carefully. The empty right side (C4-C9) offers a blank canvas, but also means any incoming pieces must be strategically placed to avoid creating new unmanageable structures or holes, or to clear existing lines on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to clear lines from the left side to reduce the dangerous height in C0-C3. The empty right side provides an excellent opportunity to stage pieces or to use long pieces (like the I-block) for multiple line clears once a suitable base is built. Given the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, a specific strategy is impossible. However, generally, it's wise to position the piece to the right, taking advantage of the vast empty space, to give more options for rotation and final placement, especially if an I-block arrives to clear the left wall. Avoid creating new holes on the left wall or accidentally topping out.\n\nGiven the critical height on the left and the unknown piece, I will move the piece to the right to buy time and provide more options for placement, especially if it's a block that can help flatten the right side or clear a line on the left.\n\nRIGHT",

Columns 4-9 are completely empty. The active piece is `UNKNOWN`. With an unknown piece, the best strategy is to maximize future placement options and avoid immediate danger. Moving the piece to the right will shift it over the empty portion of the board, providing more horizontal space and time to decide on its final placement and rotation once its shape is revealed. This is safer than placing it prematurely on the left. Since the piece is unknown, I can only plan the very next, most cautious move.\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: (right, 1)",

The board is entirely empty, as indicated by the `Column Heights Vector` of all zeros.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    No moves have been made yet as this is the start of the game.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is completely clear. All columns are at height 0. There are no holes or uneven areas to address.\n\n4.  **Strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an I_Line. On an empty board, the primary goal is to establish a clean base while keeping options open for future Tetris (four-line clear) setups. A common strategy is to place the I-piece horizontally to create a flat bottom, which can then be built upon, potentially leaving a single-column well on one side for subsequent I-pieces.\n\n**Action:**\nHARD_DROP",
