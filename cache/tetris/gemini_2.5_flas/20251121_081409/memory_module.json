  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe most critical piece of information, the `Active Piece`, is listed as `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the type of the active Tetromino, it is impossible to formulate an optimal or even a sensible placement plan. Any rotational or horizontal movement would be a blind guess and could lead to a suboptimal or even detrimental placement. The board is not in an immediate game-over state (max height 14), so there is no urgent need to hard drop. The safest action in this situation is `NO_OP`, which allows the piece to fall by one unit without any horizontal or rotational manipulation. This move is intended to gain more information about the active piece in the subsequent turn, enabling a proper plan. I cannot create a detailed `Placement_Plan` for an unknown piece.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe current game state is extremely critical. Columns 0-3 are at height 15, very close to topping out, while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This indicates a severe imbalance and an urgent need to clear lines. However, the active piece is listed as UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal or even a sensible placement plan involving rotations or specific lateral movements. Making a blind move (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) or immediately dropping (SOFT_DROP, HARD_DROP) an unknown piece carries an extremely high risk of misplacing it in a way that worsens the already dire board state, potentially leading to an immediate game over. Therefore, the only logical and risk-minimizing action in this situation is to perform a NO_OP. This action will allow the game to advance one frame, hopefully revealing the identity of the active piece in the next observation, at which point a proper strategy can be developed to address the critical board layout.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nRIGHT\n###Thought\nThe board is critically imbalanced with high stacks on the left (C0-C3: 16, 17, 17, 15) and completely empty columns on the right (C4-C9: 0). The most significant problem is that the `Active Piece` is `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the shape of the piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan. Placing a piece blindly could lead to an immediate game over if it lands poorly on the high left side.\n\nGiven the extreme uncertainty, the safest initial action is to move the piece away from the immediate danger zone on the left and towards the vast open space on the right. This does not commit to a final placement but provides more horizontal maneuvering room for when the piece shape eventually becomes known. Moving `RIGHT` is the only action that fulfills this defensive strategy in the absence of information. Any rotation or soft/hard drop would be irresponsible without knowing the piece shape.\n\nSince I cannot formulate a full plan without knowing the piece, the \"Placement_Plan\" will reflect the single, immediate, defensive action chosen.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\n(right, 1)\n###Thought\nThe board is in a critical state with columns 0 and 1 at height 19, meaning any block placed there without a line clear will result in game over. Columns 4-9 are completely empty. The active piece is `UNKNOWN`. With an unknown piece, the best strategy is to maximize future placement options and avoid immediate danger. Moving the piece to the right will shift it over the empty portion of the board, providing more horizontal space and time to decide on its final placement and rotation once its shape is revealed. This is safer than placing it prematurely on the left. Since the piece is unknown, I can only plan the very next, most cautious move.\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",
