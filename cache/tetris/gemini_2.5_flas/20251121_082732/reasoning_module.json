    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    This is the first observation, so no direct comparison to previous states can be made.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As this is the initial observation, there was no preceding move to evaluate.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in a very early stage. The left side has a small build-up: Column 0 is at height 2, while Columns 1 and 2 are at height 1. This creates a minor unevenness that could potentially form a hole if not addressed. The rest of the board (Columns 3-9) is completely empty.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is a T-Piece. With the board being mostly empty, the primary goal should be to build a flat base and avoid creating any new holes. The T-Piece offers flexibility. It can be used to flatten out the slight dip on the left side (Columns 0-2) or to begin building a low, flat foundation in the center or right of the board, potentially setting up for future line clears. A good initial strategy would be to either level the C0-C2 area or place the T-piece centrally to maintain maximum flexibility for upcoming pieces.",
    "response": "thought: The current board has column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is a T-Piece. The goal is to create a flat base and avoid holes.\n\nLet's analyze potential placements for the T-Piece:\nA standard T-piece has a 3x2 bounding box or 2x3 depending on rotation.\nIts shape is typically:\n. T .\nT T T\n\nPossible rotations and placements:\n\n1.  **No Rotation (original orientation):**\n    . T .\n    T T T\n    -   If placed starting at C0: C0 height becomes 3, C1 becomes 3, C2 becomes 2. (Board: [3, 3, 2, 0, ...]) - Creates a valley at C2. Not ideal.\n    -   If placed starting at C1: C1 height becomes 2, C2 becomes 2, C3 becomes 1. (Board: [2, 2, 2, 1, ...]) - Levels C1, C2 but creates a new height in C3 and C0 is still 2. Not great.\n    -   If placed starting at C2: C2 height becomes 1, C3 becomes 1, C4 becomes 1. (Board: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]) - Creates a new low base, but leaves the C0-C2 unevenness.\n    -   Best \"no rotation\" placement: Place it at C3. Board becomes [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]. Still leaves the initial unevenness.\n\n2.  **Rotate Right once (Spine vertical, crossbar right):**\n    T .\n    T T\n    T .\n    (This is like a T with the middle block moved to the right column, so it's a T that points right)\n    Let's visualize the block formation:\n    T (top-left)\n    T T (middle row)\n    T (bottom-left)\n    No, a T-piece rotated right is more like this (considering its center of rotation):\n    T T\n    . T\n    T .\n    (This piece is 2 blocks wide, 3 blocks high)\n    . T\n    T T\n    . T\n    Let's re-confirm T-piece rotations. Usually:\n    0:  .

T\n\n    Let's assume the standard rotation as provided by most Tetris engines.\n    Original:\n    . T . (C_x+1, Y+1)\n    T T T (C_x, Y), (C_x+1, Y), (C_x+2, Y)\n\n    Rotate Right (R0 -> R1):\n    T . (C_x, Y+1)\n    T T (C_x, Y), (C_x+1, Y)\n    T . (C_x, Y-1)\n    This is often depicted as the flat bar being vertical on the left, with the middle block poking right.\n    Example:\n    C0_Y+1, C0_Y, C0_Y-1\n    C1_Y\n    If we place it in C0, with the center of rotation effectively at (C1, Y), then:\n    Blocks would be at (C0, H+1), (C0, H), (C0, H-1), (C1, H)\n    If H is the highest existing block, this means column C0 gets taller and C1 also gets taller.\n    \n    More typically, a T-piece rotated right is represented as:\n    _ T _  (C_x+1, Y+1)\n    T T T  (C_x, Y), (C_x+1, Y), (C_x+2, Y)\n\n    Rotation states:\n    0:  # # #\n        _ # _\n    R:  _ # _\n        # # _\n        _ # _\n    2:  _ # _\n        # # #\n    L:  _ # _\n        _ # #\n        _ # _\n\n    Let's use the rotation where the 'stem' of the T points downwards.\n    Original:\n    [0,1,0]\n    [1,1,1] (base)\n\n    Rotate Right:\n    [1,0]\n    [1,1] (base)\n    [1,0]\n\n    This rotated T-piece is 2 blocks wide.\n    -   If placed starting at C0 (leftmost block at C0):\n        The blocks would cover (C0, top), (C0, mid), (C0, bot) and (C1, mid).\n        Current heights: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        If placed on C0, the C0 cells go up to height 2+3=5. C1 goes to 1+1=2.\n        Resulting board (if bottom of piece aligns with existing lowest point):\n        This piece effectively fills C0 (height +3) and C1 (height +1).\n        Holes: If C0 is 2, C1 is 1. Placing the T-rotated-right (stem down, crossbar right) at C0:\n        Blocks at (C0, base_height+0), (C0, base_height+1), (C0, base_height+2)\n        and (C1, base_height+1)\n        This is tricky given the current board state.\n\nLet's simplify. A T-piece needs a flat area of 3 or a hole of 1 for its center block.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n**Option A: Flatten the left side (columns 0-2)**\n*   The gap is at C1 (height 1) and C2 (height 1) relative to C0 (height 2).\n*   A T-piece could potentially fill this.\n*   If we rotate the T-piece to be a \"T-spin\" shape, pointing right, it's 2 wide, 3 high.\n    `X.`\n    `XX`\n    `X.`\n    If placed with its leftmost column at C0, the lowest part of the piece could be at y=0.\n    Blocks would be: (C0, 0), (C0, 1), (C0, 2), (C1, 1)\n    Current heights: C0=2, C1=1, C2=1\n    This placement would result in C0 -> max(2, 2+3)=5. C1 -> max(1, 1+1)=2. C2 remains 1. This would make the board even worse ([5,2,1,...]).\n\n*   What about a flat T-piece (original orientation) that sits on top of C1 and C2?\n    `_T_`\n    `TTT`\n    If placed at C1: (C0, y) empty, (C1, y+1), (C2, y), (C1, y), (C3, y)\n    This means C1 gets filled, C2 gets filled, C3 gets filled, and C1 gets a block on top.\n    Lowest point for piece to land: C2 is 1. If we align the T's center (C1) with C2, it will float.\n    Need to consider lowest block.\n    Let's align the bottom row of the T-piece (TTT) at y=1 (since C1 and C2 are at 1).\n    This means C0 is at y=2.\n    If we try to place the T-piece starting at C0:\n    T_Piece (original orientation):\n    . T . (C1, H+1)\n    T T T (C0, H), (C1, H), (C2, H)\n    If we land it with the lowest point at Y=1 (which is the height of C1 and C2):\n    C0 would be empty at Y=1, so it would create a hole. Not good.\n\n*   To avoid creating holes, the piece must land on an even surface or fill a hole.\n    The most straightforward approach is to land the T-piece on the lowest possible flat ground.\n    The current lowest ground is at height 0 (columns 3-9).\n\n**Option B: Build a new base on the right (columns 3-9)**\n*   If we place the T-piece (original orientation) at C3:\n    . T .\n    T T T\n    Blocks would occupy (C3, 0), (C4, 0), (C5, 0), and (C4, 1).\n    New board heights: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    This creates an immediate hole under C4, if C4 ends up at height 2.\n    No, this is not how T-pieces land.\n    The lowest blocks are (C3,0), (C4,0), (C5,0). The middle block is (C4,1).\n    This creates a base that is 3 wide, and 1 high with a bump in the middle.\n    Heights: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]. (The middle bump is irrelevant for height vector if it's over the base)\n    Actually, the T-piece occupies (X,Y), (X+1,Y), (X+2,Y) and (X+1,Y+1).\n    If it lands at Y=0, it means C_x, C_x+1, C_x+2 all become at least height 1. And C_x+1 becomes at least height 2.\n    So, if placed at C3:\n    C3 becomes 1, C4 becomes 2, C5 becomes 1.\n    Board: [2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    This creates a bump at C4, and C3/C5 are 1. This is a common T-piece shape and does not create holes *under* the piece if placed on empty ground.\n    However, the overall board roughness increases, and it doesn't address the C0,C1,C2 situation.\n\n*   What about rotating the T-piece?\n    Consider `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\n    If we rotate T-piece `ROTATE_LEFT` (or `ROTATE_RIGHT` three times):\n    . T\n    T T\n    . T\n    This is 2 wide and 3 high.\n    If placed at C3:\n    Blocks at (C3,0), (C3,1), (C3,2) and (C4,1).\n    New heights: [2, 1, 1, **3, 2**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    This creates a higher column at C3 and C4, and leaves C5 empty. This is also not ideal.\n\n    The key is to minimize \"badness\" metrics like aggregate height, holes, and roughness.\n\nLet's look for a single best move to get towards an optimal placement.\nThe board is currently [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThe most immediate target area for a T-piece would be to fill the \"hole\" at C1 and C2, relative to C0.\nHowever, a T-piece is not ideal for filling a 1-block deep \"valley\".\n\nConsider the standard T-spin setup: a T-piece rotated into a small opening.\nThe current board state does not have an obvious T-spin setup.\n\nLet's aim for a flat base. The easiest way to get a flatter base with a T-piece is to place it flat on the ground.\nPlacing it flat, without rotation, at C3:\nThe T-piece is:\n  X\n XXX\nWhen placed, its lowest blocks land on C3, C4, C5. Its 'peak' block is at C4.\nResulting heights: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis is not flat, it creates a bump.\n\nWhat if we rotate the T-piece twice (180 degrees)?\nXXX\n_X_\nNow the \"bump\" is at the bottom, and the flat bar is on top.\nIf placed at C3:\nBlocks at (C3,0), (C4,0), (C5,0) and (C4,-1).\nThis means (C4,-1) would be a hole. This rotation is only useful for covering existing bumps.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the T-piece orientation and placement strategy.\nA T-piece's fundamental shape is:\n. T .\nT T T\n(This is what `T_Piece` refers to in its initial state)\n\nOption 1: Try to level the left side.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTo level C1 and C2 up to 2, we need 1 block in C1 and 1 block in C2.\nA T-piece cannot do this perfectly.\nIf we place the T-piece starting at C0 (leftmost block of TTT at C0):\nThis means C0, C1, C2 will be covered by the bottom bar of the T-piece.\nAnd C1 will have the top block.\nC0 is at height 2. C1 is 1. C2 is 1.\nIf the bottom bar lands at Y=1 (the height of C1 and C2):\nC0 (at Y=1) would be below current C0 (at Y=2). So it would be C0 (2), C1 (1+1+1)=3, C2 (1+1)=2.\nThis means:\n- The bottom-left T-block (C0,Y) would sit on C0_Y=2. This makes C0 go to 2+1=3.\n- The bottom-middle T-block (C1,Y) would sit on C1_Y=1. This makes C1 go to 1+1=2.\n- The bottom-right T-block (C2,Y) would sit on C2_Y=1. This makes C2 go to 1+1=2.\n- The top-middle T-block (C1,Y+1) would sit on C1_Y+1=2. This makes C1 go to 2+1=3.\nResult: [3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This creates a higher stack and roughness.\n\nWhat if we want to fill the C0-C2 area?\nA single block would be (C0,3).\n(C1,2) or (C2,2).\nThe T-piece is not suited for this.\n\nSo, the best strategy is to build a low, flat base.\nCurrently, the board is mostly empty.\nA T-piece (original orientation) results in a bump if placed on flat ground.\n`_X_`\n`XXX`\nLanding on C_x, C_x+1, C_x+2 with C_x+1 having an extra block.\nHeights: C_x=1, C_x+1=2, C_x+2=1.\n\nThis means placing it at C3 (relative to the empty space starting C3):\nHeights would become [2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis is a reasonable starting point, creating a low, mostly flat 3-wide area.\nThe bump at C4 is a common feature when using a T-piece.\n\nCan we use a rotation to create a flatter surface?\nIf we rotate the T-piece to be vertical (either `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`):\n  X\n XX\n  X\nThis is a 2-wide, 3-high piece.\nLet's try `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\nIt would look like:\n. T\nT T\n. T\nNo, this is `L` rotate left.\nStandard T rotations:\n0: .x.  (center x)\n   xxx\n1: x.   (center x)\n   xx\n   x.\n2: xxx  (center x)\n   .x.\n3: .x   (center x)\n   xx\n   .x\n\nLet's assume the game is using the common \"SRS\" (Super Rotation System) rotations for a T-piece.\nInitial state:\n`0 1 0`\n`1 1 1`\nWhere (1,1) is the center of rotation.\n\n`ROTATE_RIGHT` (R0 -> R1):\n`1 0`\n`1 1`\n`1 0`\nThis is 2 cells wide, 3 cells high.\nLet's try to place this at C3.\nBlocks will be at (C3,Y), (C3,Y+1), (C3,Y+2) and (C4,Y+1).\nIf Y=0 (bottom of board):\nC3 goes to height 3. C4 goes to height 2.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, **3, 2**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis creates a very high bump at C3. Not good for flatness.\n\nConsider `ROTATE_LEFT` (R0 -> R3):\n`0 1`\n`1 1`\n`0 1`\nThis is also 2 cells wide, 3 cells high.\nIf placed at C3:\nBlocks will be at (C4,Y), (C4,Y+1), (C4,Y+2) and (C3,Y+1).\nIf Y=0:\nC4 goes to height 3. C3 goes to height 2.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, **2, 3**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nAlso a high bump.\n\nThe original orientation, placed at C3, seems to be the best for avoiding immediate high stacks, even though it creates a bump:\n[2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis is a height of 2 for C4, and 1 for C3 and C5.\n\nWhat about placing the T-piece (original orientation) to interact with the existing stack?\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThe C0-C2 area has heights 2,1,1.\nIf we place the T-piece's 'middle' block (the one that sticks up) into C0, C1, or C2, that would be tricky.\nIf the bottom part of the T piece starts at C0:\n. T . (C1, Y+1)\nT T T (C0, Y), (C1, Y), (C2, Y)\nThe piece will try to fall. The lowest possible Y for (C0,Y) is 2.\nSo (C0,2), (C1,2), (C2,2) and (C1,3).\nThis would place blocks on top of existing ones.\nC0 is 2. C1 is 1. C2 is 1.\nBlocks are at:\n(C0, 2)\n(C1, 2) (C1, 3)\n(C2, 2)\nResulting heights: C0=3, C1=4, C2=3. This is [3, 4, 3, 0, ...]. Very rough, very high. No.\n\nIf we place the T-piece starting at C1:\n. T . (C2, Y+1)\nT T T (C1, Y), (C2, Y), (C3, Y)\nLowest possible Y for (C1,Y) is 1.\nSo (C1,1), (C2,1), (C3,1) and (C2,2).\nC0=2, C1=1, C2=1, C3=0\nBlocks at:\n(C1,1)\n(C2,1) (C2,2)\n(C3,1)\nThis would mean C0 stays at 2. C1 (1) gets filled to 1+1=2. C2 (1) gets filled to 1+1+1=3. C3 (0) gets filled to 0+1=1.\nResult: [2, 2, 3, 1, 0, ...]. Also high and rough. No.\n\nSo, placing on the existing stack is not good.\nPlacing on the clear ground (C3-C9) seems better.\nBest placement for T_Piece (original orientation) is at C3:\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nConsider the actions:\nTo place the T-piece in its original orientation at C3, it needs to move `RIGHT` three times.\nThe `NO_OP` action would let the piece fall without horizontal movement or rotation.\nIf `NO_OP` is chosen, the piece would fall to C0 or C1 depending on how the game initializes.\nTypically, pieces start in the middle (e.g., C3-C5 for a 3-wide piece, or C4-C5 for a 2-wide piece).\nAssuming it starts centered on the board (e.g., C3-C5 span for a T-piece in default orientation):\nC0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9\n.  .  .  T  .  .  .  .  .  .\n.  .  .  T  T  T  .  .  .  .\nSo, if it starts centered in the usual manner, its leftmost block is at C3.\nThus, NO_OP would place it at C3.\nResult: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nLet's verify the starting position. \"Active Piece: T_Piece\". It doesn't specify its x-coordinate.\nTypically, pieces spawn centered. A T-piece is 3 wide in its default orientation, so it would span columns 3, 4, 5 (or 4, 5, 6 depending on game implementation).\nLet's assume it starts with its leftmost block at C3.\nIf this is the case, `NO_OP` would result in the board state `[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\nThis is a reasonable first move as it creates a solid, albeit slightly bumpy, low base without creating holes.\n\nWhat if we wanted to make the board flatter?\nWe need to fill the C4 height 2. An I-piece or L/J-piece could help with this later.\nFor now, creating a stable base is good.\n\nIs there any rotation that is *better*?\nWe already analyzed rotated versions leading to higher bumps.\n\nWhat if we shifted it further right?\nPlace T at C4 (leftmost block at C4):\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nThis just shifts the bump and still leaves the left side unattended.\n\nThe `NO_OP` seems to be the best first move here, assuming the piece starts centered at C3-C5.\nIt immediately places the piece, creating a new base without creating any new holes, and without making the existing stack significantly worse.\nIt also sets up for future pieces to fill the slight C4 bump, or to clear lines on the left.\n\nThe current board state is very low, so there's no immediate danger of topping out.\nThe priority is to build a clean, flat board.\n\nFinal check: `Placement_Plan` should be the full sequence.\nIf the piece starts at C3 (leftmost part of TTT at C3), then placing it without rotation or horizontal movement is just `NO_OP`.\nIf it started at C4 (leftmost part of TTT at C4), then `LEFT` once would be `NO_OP` equivalent to reach C3.\nMost games center a 4-block wide board on C0-C9, meaning it's 10 wide. A 3-wide piece usually starts with its center in column 4 (e.g., C3, C4, C5).\nSo, if the piece is spawned at (C3, Top), then `NO_OP` is the action for its final placement.\nIf the piece is spawned at (C4, Top), then `LEFT` would be the action.\nGiven the information, \"Active Piece: T_Piece\" without explicit position, the most common default is for the piece to appear centered.\nAssuming a standard 10-wide board, a 3-wide T-piece often spawns centered at columns 3-5 or 4-6. Let's assume (3,4,5).\nIn that case, `NO_OP` will make it land there.\n\nThe reasoning for the optimal placement is:\n1.  Avoid making the current unevenness (C0=2, C1=1, C2=1) worse or creating holes. Directly interacting with it using the T-piece would lead to higher, rougher stacks.\n2.  Start building a new, relatively low base in the empty part of the board.\n3.  The `T_Piece` in its initial orientation, placed at columns 3, 4, 5, creates a board state of `[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This is the lowest possible placement that avoids immediate holes or excessively high stacks.\n4.  No rotation significantly improves this initial placement for a T-piece on a flat surface. Rotated T-pieces are either 2 wide (creating higher stacks over a smaller base) or a reversed T (which creates a hole if placed on flat ground).\n5.  Moving further right would just shift the same bumpy pattern further right, leaving a larger gap between the existing stack and the new stack.\n\nTherefore, placing the T-piece with no rotation at its default spawn horizontal position (assumed C3-C5) is optimal. This corresponds to the `NO_OP` action.\nthought: The current board state shows column heights of [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is a T-Piece. The board is mostly empty, with a small uneven stack on the left.\n\nMy goal is to place the T-Piece optimally to create a flat base and avoid generating new holes or excessively high stacks.\n\nLet's evaluate the T-Piece in its default orientation and various possible placements:\nThe T-Piece shape is:\n  X\n XXX\n\n1.  **Placing on the existing stack (columns 0-2):**\n    *   If the T-Piece is placed such that its bottom-left block aligns with C0, it would effectively add blocks on top of the existing [2, 1, 1] stack. This would result in heights like [3, 4, 3, 0,...], creating a significantly higher and rougher stack. This is not desirable.\n    *   Similarly, aligning it with C1 or C2 would also result in increased heights and roughness ([2, 2, 3, 1, 0,...] if aligned with C1), and potentially creating new holes if the piece \"floats\" over a lower column.\n\n2.  **Placing on the empty part of the board (columns 3-9):**\n    *   The simplest approach is to land the T-Piece on the lowest possible flat ground, which is y=0 from C3 to C9.\n    *   Assuming the T-Piece spawns centered, its leftmost block would typically be at C3 (occupying C3, C4, C5 horizontally, with the top block at C4).\n    *   If placed in its default orientation at this position (C3-C5):\n        *   The blocks would occupy (C3,0), (C4,0), (C5,0) and (C4,1).\n        *   The resulting board heights would be: [2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n        *   This creates a new base, which is mostly flat but has a bump at C4 (height 2) and C3/C5 (height 1). This is a common and acceptable pattern for a T-piece on flat ground, as it doesn't create any holes directly beneath it.\n\n3.  **Considering Rotations:**\n    *   **Rotate Right (or Left three times):** The T-Piece becomes 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks high (e.g., `1 0 / 1 1 / 1 0`). If placed at C3, this would lead to heights like [..., 3, 2, 0,...] or [..., 2, 3, 0,...]. This creates a higher, more concentrated stack than the default orientation and increased overall board height without significant benefit.\n    *   **Rotate 180 degrees:** The T-Piece becomes `XXX / _X_`. This orientation places the \"bump\" at the bottom. If placed on flat ground, it would create a hole beneath the top block, which is highly undesirable.\n\nConclusion:\nPlacing the T-Piece in its default orientation on the empty part of the board, specifically where it naturally spawns (assuming C3-C5 horizontal span), provides the best balance of creating a low, stable base without introducing immediate holes or excessive height/roughness. This placement corresponds to taking no horizontal or rotational action for the first move, allowing it to drop in its default spawned position.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\nmove: NO_OP",
    "thought": "The current board has column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is a T-Piece.

C1 goes to 1+1=2.\n        Resulting board (if bottom of piece aligns with existing lowest point):\n        This piece effectively fills C0 (height +3) and C1 (height +1).\n        Holes: If C0 is 2, C1 is 1. Placing the T-rotated-right (stem down, crossbar right) at C0:\n        Blocks at (C0, base_height+0), (C0, base_height+1), (C0, base_height+2)\n        and (C1, base_height+1)\n        This is tricky given the current board state.\n\nLet's simplify. A T-piece needs a flat area of 3 or a hole of 1 for its center block.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n**Option A: Flatten the left side (columns 0-2)**\n*   The gap is at C1 (height 1) and C2 (height 1) relative to C0 (height 2).\n*   A T-piece could potentially fill this.\n*   If we rotate the T-piece to be a \"T-spin\" shape, pointing right, it's 2 wide, 3 high.\n    `X.`\n    `XX`\n    `X.`\n    If placed with its leftmost column at C0, the lowest part of the piece could be at y=0.\n    Blocks would be: (C0, 0), (C0, 1), (C0, 2), (C1, 1)\n    Current heights: C0=2, C1=1, C2=1\n    This placement would result in C0 -> max(2, 2+3)=5. C1 -> max(1, 1+1)=2. C2 remains 1. This would make the board even worse ([5,2,1,...]).\n\n*   What about a flat T-piece (original orientation) that sits on top of C1 and C2?\n    `_T_`\n    `TTT`\n    If placed at C1: (C0, y) empty, (C1, y+1), (C2, y), (C1, y), (C3, y)\n    This means C1 gets filled, C2 gets filled, C3 gets filled, and C1 gets a block on top.\n    Lowest point for piece to land: C2 is 1. If we align the T's center (C1) with C2, it will float.\n    Need to consider lowest block.\n    Let's align the bottom row of the T-piece (TTT) at y=1 (since C1 and C2 are at 1).\n    This means C0 is at y=2.\n    If we try to place the T-piece starting at C0:\n    T_Piece (original orientation):\n    . T . (C1, H+1)\n    T T T (C0, H), (C1, H), (C2, H)\n    If we land it with the lowest point at Y=1 (which is the height of C1 and C2):\n    C0 would be empty at Y=1, so it would create a hole. Not good.\n\n*   To avoid creating holes, the piece must land on an even surface or fill a hole.\n    The most straightforward approach is to land the T-piece on the lowest possible flat ground.\n    The current lowest ground is at height 0 (columns 3-9).\n\n**Option B: Build a new base on the right (columns 3-9)**\n*   If we place the T-piece (original orientation) at C3:\n    . T .\n    T T T\n    Blocks would occupy (C3, 0), (C4, 0), (C5, 0), and (C4, 1).\n    New board heights: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    This creates an immediate hole under C4, if C4 ends up at height 2.\n    No, this is not how T-pieces land.\n    The lowest blocks are (C3,0), (C4,0), (C5,0). The middle block is (C4,1).\n    This creates a base that is 3 wide, and 1 high with a bump in the middle.\n    Heights: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...]. (The middle bump is irrelevant for height vector if it's over the base)\n    Actually, the T-piece occupies (X,Y), (X+1,Y), (X+2,Y) and (X+1,Y+1).\n    If it lands at Y=0, it means C_x, C_x+1, C_x+2 all become at least height 1. And C_x+1 becomes at least height 2.\n    So, if placed at C3:\n    C3 becomes 1, C4 becomes 2, C5 becomes 1.\n    Board: [2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    This creates a bump at C4, and C3/C5 are 1. This is a common T-piece shape and does not create holes *under* the piece if placed on empty ground.\n    However, the overall board roughness increases, and it doesn't address the C0,C1,C2 situation.\n\n*   What about rotating the T-piece?\n    Consider `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\n    If we rotate T-piece `ROTATE_LEFT` (or `ROTATE_RIGHT` three times):\n    . T\n    T T\n    . T\n    This is 2 wide and 3 high.\n    If placed at C3:\n    Blocks at (C3,0), (C3,1), (C3,2) and (C4,1).\n    New heights: [2, 1, 1, **3, 2**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    This creates a higher column at C3 and C4, and leaves C5 empty. This is also not ideal.\n\n    The key is to minimize \"badness\" metrics like aggregate height, holes, and roughness.\n\nLet's look for a single best move to get towards an optimal placement.\nThe board is currently [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThe most immediate target area for a T-piece would be to fill the \"hole\" at C1 and C2, relative to C0.\nHowever, a T-piece is not ideal for filling a 1-block deep \"valley\".\n\nConsider the standard T-spin setup: a T-piece rotated into a small opening.\nThe current board state does not have an obvious T-spin setup.\n\nLet's aim for a flat base. The easiest way to get a flatter base with a T-piece is to place it flat on the ground.\nPlacing it flat, without rotation, at C3:\nThe T-piece is:\n  X\n XXX\nWhen placed, its lowest blocks land on C3, C4, C5. Its 'peak' block is at C4.\nResulting heights: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis is not flat, it creates a bump.\n\nWhat if we rotate the T-piece twice (180 degrees)?\nXXX\n_X_\nNow the \"bump\" is at the bottom, and the flat bar is on top.\nIf placed at C3:\nBlocks at (C3,0), (C4,0), (C5,0) and (C4,-1).\nThis means (C4,-1) would be a hole. This rotation is only useful for covering existing bumps.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the T-piece orientation and placement strategy.\nA T-piece's fundamental shape is:\n. T .\nT T T\n(This is what `T_Piece` refers to in its initial state)\n\nOption 1: Try to level the left side.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTo level C1 and C2 up to 2, we need 1 block in C1 and 1 block in C2.\nA T-piece cannot do this perfectly.\nIf we place the T-piece starting at C0 (leftmost block of TTT at C0):\nThis means C0, C1, C2 will be covered by the bottom bar of the T-piece.\nAnd C1 will have the top block.\nC0 is at height 2. C1 is 1. C2 is 1.\nIf the bottom bar lands at Y=1 (the height of C1 and C2):\nC0 (at Y=1) would be below current C0 (at Y=2). So it would be C0 (2), C1 (1+1+1)=3, C2 (1+1)=2.\nThis means:\n- The bottom-left T-block (C0,Y) would sit on C0_Y=2. This makes C0 go to 2+1=3.\n- The bottom-middle T-block (C1,Y) would sit on C1_Y=1. This makes C1 go to 1+1=2.\n- The bottom-right T-block (C2,Y) would sit on C2_Y=1. This makes C2 go to 1+1=2.\n- The top-middle T-block (C1,Y+1) would sit on C1_Y+1=2. This makes C1 go to 2+1=3.\nResult: [3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This creates a higher stack and roughness.\n\nWhat if we want to fill the C0-C2 area?\nA single block would be (C0,3).\n(C1,2) or (C2,2).\nThe T-piece is not suited for this.\n\nSo, the best strategy is to build a low, flat base.\nCurrently, the board is mostly empty.\nA T-piece (original orientation) results in a bump if placed on flat ground.\n`_X_`\n`XXX`\nLanding on C_x, C_x+1, C_x+2 with C_x+1 having an extra block.\nHeights: C_x=1, C_x+1=2, C_x+2=1.\n\nThis means placing it at C3 (relative to the empty space starting C3):\nHeights would become [2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis is a reasonable starting point, creating a low, mostly flat 3-wide area.\nThe bump at C4 is a common feature when using a T-piece.\n\nCan we use a rotation to create a flatter surface?\nIf we rotate the T-piece to be vertical (either `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT`):\n  X\n XX\n  X\nThis is a 2-wide, 3-high piece.\nLet's try `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\nIt would look like:\n. T\nT T\n. T\nNo, this is `L` rotate left.\nStandard T rotations:\n0: .x.  (center x)\n   xxx\n1: x.   (center x)\n   xx\n   x.\n2: xxx  (center x)\n   .x.\n3: .x   (center x)\n   xx\n   .x\n\nLet's assume the game is using the common \"SRS\" (Super Rotation System) rotations for a T-piece.\nInitial state:\n`0 1 0`\n`1 1 1`\nWhere (1,1) is the center of rotation.\n\n`ROTATE_RIGHT` (R0 -> R1):\n`1 0`\n`1 1`\n`1 0`\nThis is 2 cells wide, 3 cells high.\nLet's try to place this at C3.\nBlocks will be at (C3,Y), (C3,Y+1), (C3,Y+2) and (C4,Y+1).\nIf Y=0 (bottom of board):\nC3 goes to height 3. C4 goes to height 2.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, **3, 2**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis creates a very high bump at C3. Not good for flatness.\n\nConsider `ROTATE_LEFT` (R0 -> R3):\n`0 1`\n`1 1`\n`0 1`\nThis is also 2 cells wide, 3 cells high.\nIf placed at C3:\nBlocks will be at (C4,Y), (C4,Y+1), (C4,Y+2) and (C3,Y+1).\nIf Y=0:\nC4 goes to height 3. C3 goes to height 2.\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, **2, 3**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nAlso a high bump.\n\nThe original orientation, placed at C3, seems to be the best for avoiding immediate high stacks, even though it creates a bump:\n[2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis is a height of 2 for C4, and 1 for C3 and C5.\n\nWhat about placing the T-piece (original orientation) to interact with the existing stack?\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThe C0-C2 area has heights 2,1,1.\nIf we place the T-piece's 'middle' block (the one that sticks up) into C0, C1, or C2, that would be tricky.\nIf the bottom part of the T piece starts at C0:\n. T . (C1, Y+1)\nT T T (C0, Y), (C1, Y), (C2, Y)\nThe piece will try to fall. The lowest possible Y for (C0,Y) is 2.\nSo (C0,2), (C1,2), (C2,2) and (C1,3).\nThis would place blocks on top of existing ones.\nC0 is 2. C1 is 1. C2 is 1.\nBlocks are at:\n(C0, 2)\n(C1, 2) (C1, 3)\n(C2, 2)\nResulting heights: C0=3, C1=4, C2=3. This is [3, 4, 3, 0, ...]. Very rough, very high. No.\n\nIf we place the T-piece starting at C1:\n. T . (C2, Y+1)\nT T T (C1, Y), (C2, Y), (C3, Y)\nLowest possible Y for (C1,Y) is 1.\nSo (C1,1), (C2,1), (C3,1) and (C2,2).\nC0=2, C1=1, C2=1, C3=0\nBlocks at:\n(C1,1)\n(C2,1) (C2,2)\n(C3,1)\nThis would mean C0 stays at 2. C1 (1) gets filled to 1+1=2. C2 (1) gets filled to 1+1+1=3. C3 (0) gets filled to 0+1=1.\nResult: [2, 2, 3, 1, 0, ...]. Also high and rough. No.\n\nSo, placing on the existing stack is not good.\nPlacing on the clear ground (C3-C9) seems better.\nBest placement for T_Piece (original orientation) is at C3:\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nConsider the actions:\nTo place the T-piece in its original orientation at C3, it needs to move `RIGHT` three times.\nThe `NO_OP` action would let the piece fall without horizontal movement or rotation.\nIf `NO_OP` is chosen, the piece would fall to C0 or C1 depending on how the game initializes.\nTypically, pieces start in the middle (e.g., C3-C5 for a 3-wide piece, or C4-C5 for a 2-wide piece).\nAssuming it starts centered on the board (e.g., C3-C5 span for a T-piece in default orientation):\nC0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9\n.  .  .  T  .  .  .  .  .  .\n.  .  .  T  T  T  .  .  .  .\nSo, if it starts centered in the usual manner, its leftmost block is at C3.\nThus, NO_OP would place it at C3.\nResult: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nLet's verify the starting position. \"Active Piece: T_Piece\". It doesn't specify its x-coordinate.\nTypically, pieces spawn centered. A T-piece is 3 wide in its default orientation, so it would span columns 3, 4, 5 (or 4, 5, 6 depending on game implementation).\nLet's assume it starts with its leftmost block at C3.\nIf this is the case, `NO_OP` would result in the board state `[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\nThis is a reasonable first move as it creates a solid, albeit slightly bumpy, low base without creating holes.\n\nWhat if we wanted to make the board flatter?\nWe need to fill the C4 height 2. An I-piece or L/J-piece could help with this later.\nFor now, creating a stable base is good.\n\nIs there any rotation that is *better*?\nWe already analyzed rotated versions leading to higher bumps.\n\nWhat if we shifted it further right?\nPlace T at C4 (leftmost block at C4):\nBoard: [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nThis just shifts the bump and still leaves the left side unattended.\n\nThe `NO_OP` seems to be the best first move here, assuming the piece starts centered at C3-C5.\nIt immediately places the piece, creating a new base without creating any new holes, and without making the existing stack significantly worse.\nIt also sets up for future pieces to fill the slight C4 bump, or to clear lines on the left.\n\nThe current board state is very low, so there's no immediate danger of topping out.\nThe priority is to build a clean, flat board.\n\nFinal check: `Placement_Plan` should be the full sequence.\nIf the piece starts at C3 (leftmost part of TTT at C3), then placing it without rotation or horizontal movement is just `NO_OP`.\nIf it started at C4 (leftmost part of TTT at C4), then `LEFT` once would be `NO_OP` equivalent to reach C3.\nMost games center a 4-block wide board on C0-C9, meaning it's 10 wide. A 3-wide piece usually starts with its center in column 4 (e.g., C3, C4, C5).\nSo, if the piece is spawned at (C3, Top), then `NO_OP` is the action for its final placement.\nIf the piece is spawned at (C4, Top), then `LEFT` would be the action.\nGiven the information, \"Active Piece: T_Piece\" without explicit position, the most common default is for the piece to appear centered.\nAssuming a standard 10-wide board, a 3-wide T-piece often spawns centered at columns 3-5 or 4-6. Let's assume (3,4,5).\nIn that case, `NO_OP` will make it land there.\n\nThe reasoning for the optimal placement is:\n1.  Avoid making the current unevenness (C0=2, C1=1, C2=1) worse or creating holes. Directly interacting with it using the T-piece would lead to higher, rougher stacks.\n2.  Start building a new, relatively low base in the empty part of the board.\n3.  The `T_Piece` in its initial orientation, placed at columns 3, 4, 5, creates a board state of `[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This is the lowest possible placement that avoids immediate holes or excessively high stacks.\n4.  No rotation significantly improves this initial placement for a T-piece on a flat surface. Rotated T-pieces are either 2 wide (creating higher stacks over a smaller base) or a reversed T (which creates a hole if placed on flat ground).\n5.  Moving further right would just shift the same bumpy pattern further right, leaving a larger gap between the existing stack and the new stack.\n\nTherefore, placing the T-piece with no rotation at its default spawn horizontal position (assumed C3-C5) is optimal. This corresponds to the `NO_OP` action.\nthought: The current board state shows column heights of [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is a T-Piece. The board is mostly empty, with a small uneven stack on the left.\n\nMy goal is to place the T-Piece optimally to create a flat base and avoid generating new holes or excessively high stacks.\n\nLet's evaluate the T-Piece in its default orientation and various possible placements:\nThe T-Piece shape is:\n  X\n XXX\n\n1.  **Placing on the existing stack (columns 0-2):**\n    *   If the T-Piece is placed such that its bottom-left block aligns with C0, it would effectively add blocks on top of the existing [2, 1, 1] stack. This would result in heights like [3, 4, 3, 0,...], creating a significantly higher and rougher stack. This is not desirable.\n    *   Similarly, aligning it with C1 or C2 would also result in increased heights and roughness ([2, 2, 3, 1, 0,...] if aligned with C1), and potentially creating new holes if the piece \"floats\" over a lower column.\n\n2.  **Placing on the empty part of the board (columns 3-9):**\n    *   The simplest approach is to land the T-Piece on the lowest possible flat ground, which is y=0 from C3 to C9.\n    *   Assuming the T-Piece spawns centered, its leftmost block would typically be at C3 (occupying C3, C4, C5 horizontally, with the top block at C4).\n    *   If placed in its default orientation at this position (C3-C5):\n        *   The blocks would occupy (C3,0), (C4,0), (C5,0) and (C4,1).\n        *   The resulting board heights would be: [2, 1, 1, **1, 2, 1**, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n        *   This creates a new base, which is mostly flat but has a bump at C4 (height 2) and C3/C5 (height 1). This is a common and acceptable pattern for a T-piece on flat ground, as it doesn't create any holes directly beneath it.\n\n3.  **Considering Rotations:**\n    *   **Rotate Right (or Left three times):** The T-Piece becomes 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks high (e.g., `1 0 / 1 1 / 1 0`). If placed at C3, this would lead to heights like [..., 3, 2, 0,...] or [..., 2, 3, 0,...]. This creates a higher, more concentrated stack than the default orientation and increased overall board height without significant benefit.\n    *   **Rotate 180 degrees:** The T-Piece becomes `XXX / _X_`. This orientation places the \"bump\" at the bottom. If placed on flat ground, it would create a hole beneath the top block, which is highly undesirable.\n\nConclusion:\nPlacing the T-Piece in its default orientation on the empty part of the board, specifically where it naturally spawns (assuming C3-C5 horizontal span), provides the best balance of creating a low, stable base without introducing immediate holes or excessive height/roughness. This placement corresponds to taking no horizontal or rotational action for the first move, allowing it to drop in its default spawned position.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As no previous context was provided, I cannot assess how the board has changed. Currently, the board features a significant build-up on the left (columns C0-C3 with heights [5, 5, 3, 3]) and a completely clear right side (columns C4-C9 are all at height 0). This creates a very open and low-lying area across more than half the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the effectiveness of the last move is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The primary area needing attention is the wide-open expanse from column C4 to C9. This clean slate presents a major opportunity but also a risk if not managed properly. The unevenness on the left (heights 5, 5, 3, 3) also requires attention to smooth out the surface and create line-clear opportunities without introducing new holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the `J_Piece` and the largely empty right side of the board:\n    *   **Build a Base:** The most immediate strategy should be to begin building a low, flat base across columns C4-C9. This will help level the board and prepare for future line clears.\n    *   **Setup for I-piece:** The clear area is ideal for setting up a well for an `I_Piece` to achieve a Tetris (4-line clear). The `J_Piece` can be oriented to help form one side of this well, perhaps by dropping it in C4 or C5, rotated to lay flat or stand vertically to form part of a wall.\n    *   **Avoid Isolated Pillars/Holes:** When building on the right, ensure the `J_Piece` placement contributes to a flat, contiguous surface, or a well structure, and does not create new, hard-to-fill holes or isolated tall blocks.\n    *   **Address Left Unevenness (Secondary):** While building the right, keep in mind the C2/C3 area is lower. Future pieces might be used to even this out, but the immediate priority is to utilize the open space effectively.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot directly assess changes. However, the current board state is characterized by extreme unevenness. The left side (columns 0, 1, 2) is relatively high with heights of 10, 10, and 11 respectively. Column 3 is significantly lower at height 3, creating a deep valley. The right side of the board (columns 4 through 9) is completely empty. This configuration suggests either an intentional deep well strategy or a series of placements that have led to a highly imbalanced board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With \"Active Piece: UNKNOWN\" and no previous context, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move. However, the current board state presents both a challenge and an opportunity due to its unique high-left, empty-right structure.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Columns 0-2 (High Left):** These columns are quite high and uneven, making them a potential source of game over if not managed. While not immediately critical, they will require attention to clear lines as the game progresses.\n    *   **Column 3 (Deep Valley):** This column is very low (height 3) and creates a significant pit. It needs to be carefully filled to level the board, or integrated into a larger clearing strategy.\n    *   **Columns 4-9 (Empty Right):** This vast empty space is the most prominent feature. It represents an excellent opportunity for line clears, especially Tetris clears, if an I-piece becomes available. Maintaining this open space while building up C3 is crucial.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Leveling the Right:** The primary strategic goal should be to utilize the completely empty columns (4-9) to prepare for multiple line clears, ideally a Tetris. Pieces should be placed to fill in C3 and build up C4-C9 from the bottom, aiming for a flat surface at the target Tetris height.\n    *   **Maintain the \"Well\":** The deep valley in C3, combined with the empty columns to its right, forms a perfect setup for a Tetris well. Future placements should aim to preserve this structure while bringing up C3 to a level that can form a flat base with C4-C9.\n    *   **Address Left Side in Conjunction:** While focusing on the right, the high left side (C0-C2) cannot be ignored. When possible, pieces should be used to clear lines on the left without compromising the Tetris setup on the right.\n    *   **Adaptive Placement:** Without knowing the active piece, the general strategy is to prioritize filling the empty right side to achieve a flat, low base, and then using taller pieces to address the height disparity with the left side. Always look for opportunities to clear lines, especially 4-line Tetris clears, which would significantly improve the board state.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot directly assess changes. However, the current board state, with columns 4-9 completely empty while columns 0-2 are relatively high (11-12), suggests a significant and highly unusual development. This indicates either a massive multi-line clear has occurred recently, or the board has been played very unconventionally, leading to a deep, wide chasm.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move. The current board presents a critical situation that needs immediate strategic attention.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area is the massive gap spanning columns 4 through 9, which are all at height 0. This needs to be built up urgently to create a playable surface. Simultaneously, columns 0, 1, and 2 are quite high (11, 12, 12), creating a significant height imbalance and potentially limiting maneuverability on the left side. Column 3, at height 3, is isolated between the high wall and the deep chasm.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate and paramount strategy must be to **fill the void in columns 4-9**. Every piece should be prioritized for placement in this region to level the board. The unknown active piece makes specific planning impossible, but any piece that can contribute to building height in C4-C9 should be used there. Avoid placing pieces in columns 0-2 unless it's to clear a line and reduce height, or if absolutely no other option is viable in the empty columns. Once the large gap is somewhat filled, focus on creating horizontal lines to clear multiple layers and reduce the overall board height, particularly on the left side.",
    "response": "thought: The active piece is UNKNOWN, making precise planning impossible. However, the board state clearly shows that columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0), while columns 0, 1, and 2 are significantly high (11, 12, 12). The most critical strategic goal is to fill the large void on the right side of the board (columns 4-9). To begin achieving this, any incoming piece should be moved towards the rightmost, lowest available area. Therefore, the immediate and most logical first action, despite the unknown piece, is to move the piece to the right. This positions it closer to the target area without making any rotational assumptions that could be detrimental. Since I don't know the piece, I cannot specify rotations or how many right moves are ultimately needed, but the first step is to initiate movement to the right.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

However, the current board state is characterized by a significant disparity: columns 0-3 are consistently high (height 13), while columns 4-9 are completely empty. This suggests a large void has been created or maintained on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without information on the previous move or the piece that was placed, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The large, empty six-column well (columns 4-9) is the primary area needing attention. This void represents both a danger if not managed and a massive opportunity for multi-line clears. The left wall (columns 0-3) is quite high, indicating less room for error there.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right void:** The immediate goal should be to build up the right side of the board (columns 4-9) to create a flat surface for line clears.\n    *   **Capitalize on the \"well\":** This open space is ideal for placing an I-piece vertically to achieve a Tetris (4-line clear), which would significantly reduce the board height.\n    *   **Maintain awareness of the left wall:** Avoid placing pieces on the left wall (columns 0-3) unless it results in an immediate line clear, as increasing its height will push the game closer to the top-out state.\n    *   **Adapt to unknown piece:** Since the active piece is unknown, the strategy must be flexible.

This creates a very large \"well\" or \"trench\" on the right side of the board.

This allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its type or giving a better view of the board state with the piece in a lower position, which might then allow for a more informed move.

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nGiven that there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate how the board has changed. I can only describe its current state.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout prior states or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe board is critically imbalanced. Columns C0 through C3 are very high (heights 14, 15, 15, 13), while columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a massive, deep well on the right side of the board. The most urgent areas for attention are filling these empty columns (C4-C9) and reducing the overall board height, especially on the left.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe primary strategic goal is to level the board by filling the vast empty space on the right (C4-C9). All incoming pieces should be prioritized for placement in these rightmost columns to build a foundation. Since the active piece is 'UNKNOWN', the immediate action should be to shift the piece towards the right to begin addressing the large gap. Building from C9 inwards would be ideal, or at least attempting to bridge the gap from C3 to C4 to create a more even playing field. Given the current high left side, creating new holes there must be avoided.",

With an unknown piece, the best strategy is to move it generally towards the target area where it needs to be placed. In this case, the target area is the large empty space on the right side of the board (C4-C9). Moving the piece to the right is the most appropriate first step to prepare for any incoming piece to fill this gap and level the board. I will plan to move it right multiple times to ensure it's positioned over the empty columns, but for this turn, I will execute the first 'RIGHT' action.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, right, right\nmove: right",

This is the initial observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is extremely imbalanced.\n    *   Columns C0 to C3 are significantly high, ranging from 13 to 17.\n    *   Columns C4 to C9 are entirely empty (height 0). This creates a massive, deep well/canyon across the right half of the board.\n    *   The primary area of concern is this profound height discrepancy. The left side is close to topping out, while the right side is completely open.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize filling the right side (C4-C9):** The immediate goal should be to bring up the height of columns C4-C9 to reduce the extreme disparity. Any piece that can drop into this wide-open space to create a flatter surface should be considered.\n    *   **Avoid placing pieces on the left (C0-C3):** Adding blocks to the already high left columns would only exacerbate the problem and push the board closer to a game over. Only place pieces here if it results in an immediate, significant line clear.\n    *   **Look for opportunities to clear lines on the right:** Once blocks start filling C4-C9, aim for horizontal line clears to efficiently reduce the \"canyon\" depth.\n    *   **Maintain a flat base on the right:** As C4-C9 fill, try to keep their heights as even as possible to create a \"tetris-ready\" well, especially if an I-block becomes available.\n    *   The `Active Piece` is unknown, which limits specific tactical advice, but the overarching strategy must focus on leveling the board by building up the right side.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As I do not have access to previous game states or contexts, I cannot comment on how the board has changed over time. My analysis is based solely on the current observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Information regarding the last move or the thought process behind it is unavailable, so I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing immediate attention is the **left side of the board**. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are dangerously high (19, 19, 18 respectively), nearing the top of the playfield. Column 3 is also significant at height 13. This imbalance presents an extreme risk of topping out. The **right side of the board (columns 4-9) is completely empty**, offering a large, clear space, but this doesn't directly alleviate the immediate danger on the left.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Immediate Survival:** The primary objective is to survive the imminent threat of topping out on the left. Any piece that can clear lines in columns 0-3, especially an 'I' piece for a Tetris, should be prioritized.\n    *   **Active Piece (UNKNOWN):** Since the active piece is unknown, specific placement advice is limited. However, the general strategy must be to avoid increasing the height of columns 0-3 unless it directly results in a line clear.\n    *   **Utilize Right Side:** If the active piece cannot clear lines on the left, it should be placed safely on the right side (columns 4-9) to minimize risk, even if this means temporarily building up that area. The goal here is to buy time.\n    *   **Avoid Holes on Left:** Be extremely cautious about creating any new holes on the left side that cannot be easily filled, as this will further complicate line clears.\n    *   **Wait for 'I' Piece:** The board is desperate for an 'I' piece to perform a multi-line clear on the left. The current strategy should be to survive until such a piece appears.",

The board is critically high on the left side (columns 0, 1, 2 are at height 19, 19, 18). Any blind movement (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could cause an immediate game over if the piece spawns tall and moves into an already high column.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context to compare against. Based on the current `Column Heights Vector` being `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the board is completely empty. This indicates the start of a new game.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior context, no last move can be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is pristine and empty. No specific areas require attention due to existing structures. The entire board is available for placement.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current active piece is an `I_Line` on a completely empty board. This is an excellent opportunity to establish a strong, flat base. Placing the `I_Line` horizontally at the bottom of the board (e.g., across columns 3-6 or 2-5) is a standard opening move. Alternatively, if aiming for a very aggressive Tetris setup early, one could place it vertically in one of the far columns, though generally a horizontal base is preferred with the first piece to maximize options for subsequent pieces. The primary goal for this move is to create a solid, low foundation without creating any holes.",
    "response": "thought: The board is completely empty, and the active piece is an I-Line. The most optimal opening strategy with an I-Line is to place it horizontally at the bottom of the board to create a wide, flat base. This allows for flexible placement of subsequent pieces and maximizes future line-clearing opportunities. To achieve this, the I-Line, which typically spawns vertically, needs to be rotated once. A `ROTATE_RIGHT` action will change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Assuming standard spawn points, this single rotation should position it centrally enough for the first piece. Further fine-tuning with `LEFT` or `RIGHT` might be needed in subsequent steps if it's not perfectly centered, but the rotation is the immediate critical action.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right\nmove: rotate_right",
