  "###Action\n(NO_OP, 1)\n###Thought\nThe board state shows a significant imbalance: columns 0-3 are at height 13, and columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a very large \"well\" or \"trench\" on the right side of the board. The active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes precise planning impossible.\n\nGiven an unknown active piece, the best immediate strategy is to use `NO_OP`. This allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its type or giving a better view of the board state with the piece in a lower position, which might then allow for a more informed move. Without knowing the piece, any movement or rotation could be detrimental or waste an action that would have been better spent later.\n\nThe priority for the long term will be to fill the well in columns 4-9, ideally with an I-piece for a Tetris, or any piece that can help flatten the surface. However, with an unknown piece, the most conservative and often safest first action is to let gravity do its work for one step and observe.\n\nSince I have to provide a full plan and then the first action, and the piece is unknown, my plan is to \"wait and see\". If the piece were known, I would develop a concrete plan. As it's unknown, the only reasonable \"plan\" for the immediate step is to not intervene, effectively letting it drop one unit. This is represented by `NO_OP`.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

The long-term strategy would be to fill the right side to level the board, but I cannot apply this strategy to an unknown piece.\n\nGiven the inability to plan due to missing information, the only logical and safe action is `NO_OP`. This prevents making a random, potentially detrimental manipulation and indicates that no informed action can be taken at this moment.\n\nPlacement_Plan: No optimal plan can be formulated as the Active Piece is UNKNOWN.\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN. This means I have no information about its shape or how it will fit into the current board state. The board is critically high on the left side (columns 0, 1, 2 are at height 19, 19, 18). Any blind movement (LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT) could cause an immediate game over if the piece spawns tall and moves into an already high column. The safest and most rational move when the active piece is unknown is to perform a NO_OP. This allows the piece to fall one step, potentially revealing its shape and giving me information to plan the next specific move without risking an immediate mistake.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nrotate_right\n###Thought\nThe board is completely empty, and the active piece is an I-Line. The most optimal opening strategy with an I-Line is to place it horizontally at the bottom of the board to create a wide, flat base. This allows for flexible placement of subsequent pieces and maximizes future line-clearing opportunities. To achieve this, the I-Line, which typically spawns vertically, needs to be rotated once. A `ROTATE_RIGHT` action will change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Assuming standard spawn points, this single rotation should position it centrally enough for the first piece. Further fine-tuning with `LEFT` or `RIGHT` might be needed in subsequent steps if it's not perfectly centered, but the rotation is the immediate critical action.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right\n"
