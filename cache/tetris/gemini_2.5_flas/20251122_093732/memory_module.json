  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe current board has column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I_Line. The goal is to place the I_Line to clear lines or maintain a flat board for future placements, avoiding holes.\n\nPlacing the I_Line horizontally across columns 3, 4, 5, and 6 seems optimal. These columns are currently at height 0. Placing the I_Line here would result in these columns becoming height 1, creating a flat base on the right side of the board. The resulting column heights would be [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This creates a smooth landing area and keeps the board relatively low.\n\nI will assume the I_Line spawns in a default horizontal orientation, centered on the board. A common spawn for the I_Line is such that it occupies columns 3, 4, 5, 6. If this is the case, no rotation or horizontal movement is needed. If it spawns in a different position (e.g., columns 2, 3, 4, 5), I would need to move it right once. Since there's no explicit spawn position, and the desired placement is the central empty region, NO_OP is the safest initial move, implying the piece is already correctly positioned or only needs a drop.\n\nPlacement_Plan: no_op\n",

  "###Action\nrotate_right\n###Thought\nThe board has a significant imbalance: columns C0-C3 are at height 3, while C4-C9 are at height 0. The active piece is a Z-Piece.\n\nThe Z-Piece is made of four blocks, typically in a 2x3 area or 3x2 area depending on rotation.\nInitial orientation (horizontal):\nXX\n XX\n(blocks at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) relative to its anchor)\n\nRotated orientation (vertical):\n X\nXX\nX\n(blocks at (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,2) relative to its anchor)\n\nOur goal is to try and level the board, or at least start building up the empty right side without creating new holes on the left.\n\nLet's consider placement options for the Z-Piece:\n\n1.  **Place on the left (C0-C3):** This would only make the existing high columns higher and exacerbate the height difference, or create holes if placed carelessly. This is generally not a good idea unless clearing a line is imminent, which it isn't here.\n\n2.  **Place in the middle (C3-C5):**\n    *   **Option A: Horizontal Z (XX/ XX) starting at C3:**\n        If placed such that the left-most block is in C3, the shape would occupy (C3, C4) at height 3, and (C4, C5) at height 4. This would make C3=4, C4=4, C5=4. This is a possibility to connect the left side to the right side, but it raises the height in C3 and C4, and C5 is still low. It also doesn't really address the vast empty space on the right.\n        (C3:3, C4:3, C5:0, C6:0) -> Z piece at (C3,3), (C4,3), (C4,4), (C5,4) would make heights (C3:4, C4:5, C5:5, C6:0) This would create a column 4 height 5 and column 5 height 5. This is not good.\n\n    *   **Option B: Vertical Z ( X/XX/X) starting at C3:**\n        If the bottom-left block of the vertical Z is in C3, then blocks are at (C3,3), (C2,4), (C3,4), (C2,5). This would create a very uneven structure, making C2 and C3 even higher and creating a hole. Not good.\n        If the 'middle' block of the vertical Z is at (C3,3) then it's (C2,4), (C3,3), (C4,4), (C3,5). This also makes things very messy and tall.\n\n3.  **Place on the right (C4-C9):** This is the most strategic area to target. The board is completely flat at height 0 from C4 to C9.\n    *   **Option A: Horizontal Z (XX/ XX) in C4-C6:**\n        Place it such that the bottom-left block is at (C4,0). The piece would occupy (C4,0), (C5,0), (C5,1), (C6,1).\n        This would result in: C4=1, C5=2, C6=2. The new heights would be [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,0,0,0].\n        This creates a small step up on the right side and begins to fill the empty space. This is a decent option.\n\n    *   **Option B: Horizontal Z (XX/ XX) in C5-C7:**\n        Place it such that the bottom-left block is at (C5,0). The piece would occupy (C5,0), (C6,0), (C6,1), (C7,1).\n        This would result in: C5=1, C6=2, C7=2. The new heights would be [3,3,3,3,0,1,2,2,0,0].\n        This also builds up the right side, keeping C4 open for other pieces.\n\n    *   **Option C: Rotated Vertical Z ( X/XX/X) in C4-C5:**\n        If the bottom block (the single one) is at (C4,0), then the piece would occupy (C4,0), (C3,1), (C4,1), (C3,2). This makes C3 very high and is definitely not good.\n        If we want to place it vertically, the \"center\" of the Z is often considered to be the second block of the central horizontal segment. A standard Z piece (S-piece) has a structure where rotation keeps it within a 3x3 box.\n        A Z_Piece (as shown in common Tetris variants) is:\n        Standard orientation:\n        . . . .\n        . X X .\n        X X . .\n        . . . .\n        This would take (col,row): (1,1), (2,1), (0,2), (1,2)\n        Rotated orientation:\n        . . . .\n        X . . .\n        X X . .\n        . X . .\n        This would take (col,row): (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n        Let's re-evaluate based on the typical 'Z' shape and its rotations.\n        Z_Piece:\n        Shape 0 (horizontal):\n        ..X\n        .XX\n        X..\n        This Z piece is L-shaped. No, this is wrong. That's a T or L.\n\n        The problem description states `Active Piece: Z_Piece`. A standard Z-piece has the shape:\n        XX.\n        .XX\n\n        Let's assume standard orientation (spawned in columns 3-5, usually at height 20-21):\n        Blocks at relative (row, col) from top-left of 3x2 bounding box:\n        (0,0), (0,1)\n        (1,1), (1,2)\n        So it occupies (C3,Y), (C4,Y), (C4,Y-1), (C5,Y-1) in a falling state.\n\n        Rotated 90 degrees clockwise (let's say `rotate_right`):\n        .X.\n        XX.\n        X..\n        Blocks at relative (row, col):\n        (0,1)\n        (1,0), (1,1)\n        (2,0)\n        So it occupies (C4,Y), (C3,Y-1), (C4,Y-1), (C3,Y-2)\n\n        Let's re-evaluate placement based on these shapes, focusing on building up C4-C9.\n\n        **Current Board:** [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        **Active Piece: Z_Piece** (standard horizontal orientation: XX./.XX)\n\n        **Scenario 1: Place horizontally (XX./.XX)**\n        *   **Left-most column at C3:** This would mean the piece occupies (C3,H3), (C4,H3), and (C4,H3+1), (C5,H3+1).\n            Current heights: (C3:3, C4:0, C5:0).\n            Landing would result in C3=4, C4=1, C5=1.\n            New heights: [3,3,3,4,1,1,0,0,0,0]. This is terrible. It makes C3 higher and doesn't adequately fill the gap.\n\n        *   **Left-most column at C4:** (This means the first block (0,0) of the Z is in C4).\n            Piece occupies (C4,0), (C5,0), (C5,1), (C6,1).\n            New heights: [3,3,3,3,1,2,2,0,0,0].\n            This starts to build up the right side. It creates a small step. This is a plausible move.\n            To achieve this, the piece needs to move right one or two times (depending on initial spawn position, typically C3-C5 centered, so it starts spanning C3, C4, C5). If it spawns centered at C4, it covers C3,C4,C5. To put the left-most block at C4, it needs to move right from original spawn.\n            Let's assume spawn at C3-C5 (centered on C4 column for block (0,1)).\n            Spawn:\n            ..X (C3,C4)\n            .XX (C4,C5)\n            No, a Z piece is usually:\n            .XX (C3,C4)\n            XX. (C2,C3)\n            Let's assume standard Tetris guidelines where the piece spawns high in the middle, typically like this for a Z:\n            C3 C4 C5 C6 C7\n             .  X  X  .  .\n             X  X  .  .  .\n            This would mean it covers C2, C3, C4, C5 if it landed there. This doesn't match the general definition for Z or S pieces.\n\n        Let's use the simple shape and assume the \"top-left\" of the piece is what we move.\n        **Z_Piece (spawned horizontally):**\n        [ ][ ][X][X]\n        [ ][X][X][ ]\n        So, a Z_piece covers 3 columns. If it's `XX.` / `.XX`, it occupies 3 columns.\n        If it's `XX.` at top and `.XX` at bottom. The top part covers C3, C4. The bottom part covers C4, C5.\n        So, if the piece drops: C3 gets 1 block, C4 gets 2 blocks, C5 gets 1 block.\n        If we move it right once: C4 gets 1 block, C5 gets 2 blocks, C6 gets 1 block.\n        Current heights: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        **Placement Option 1: Horizontal Z (default orientation), shifted right 1-2 times to start at C4.**\n        If the Z piece is `XX.` over `.XX`, then placing its left-most block (the one in the top row, left-most) into C4 would mean:\n        The top segment `XX` occupies (C4,0) and (C5,0).\n        The bottom segment `.XX` occupies (C5,1) and (C6,1).\n        Resulting heights: [3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]\n        This looks like a good option to start building the right side.\n        To get there, assuming default spawn where the piece is centered (often starting in C3, C4, C5 or C2, C3, C4):\n        If spawn is C3,C4,C5: it needs to move `right`.\n        If spawn is C2,C3,C4: it needs to move `right`, `right`.\n\n        **Placement Option 2: Rotated Z (vertical orientation), shifted right.**\n        Rotated Z (`.X.`/`XX.`/`X..`)\n        If placed such that the bottom-left block (the single one) is at C4:\n        It occupies (C4,0), (C4,1), (C5,1), (C5,2).\n        Resulting heights: [3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0]\n        This also builds up C4 and C5, and keeps them relatively low. It makes C4=2, C5=2. This is also a good option.\n        To get to this: `rotate_right` and then `right` some number of times.\n\n        Let's compare Option 1 (Horizontal Z, C4-C6) and Option 2 (Rotated Z, C4-C5).\n        Option 1: Final heights [3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]. Max height 3. Creates a small internal hole (column 6 height 1 vs column 5 height 2).\n        Option 2: Final heights [3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0]. Max height 3. Creates a flat top between C4 and C5.\n\n        Option 2 seems slightly better because it creates a flatter top between C4 and C5, which is easier to build upon with subsequent pieces without creating new holes.\n        The overall height profile after Option 2 would be: [3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0].\n        This is relatively flat in the built-up area and leaves the rest of the right side open for future pieces.\n\n        Let's choose Option 2.\n        To achieve this, the Z-Piece needs to be rotated once (e.g., `rotate_right`) and then moved to the right.\n        The `move` action takes only one step. So the first step is `rotate_right`.\n\n        Let's double check the Z_Piece rotation:\n        Common Z-piece (S-piece in some games) has blocks at (x,y), (x+1,y), (x+1,y+1), (x+2,y+1).\n        This is `XX` on top and `.XX` below, but shifted right one unit.\n        Spawn usually looks like this (relative to top-left of a 4x4 matrix, in a (row,col) format for clarity):\n        Piece: Z_Piece\n        Initial orientation:\n        [ ][ ][ ][ ]\n        [ ][X][X][ ] -> (1,1), (1,2)\n        [X][X][ ][ ] -> (2,0), (2,1)\n        This piece occupies C1, C2, C3. If it starts at C1. (This is a common spawn.)\n\n        Let's assume the board is 0-indexed columns.\n        Heights: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        Active Piece: Z_Piece\n\n        Let's use the representation from the image which typically defines Z_Piece as:\n        .XX\n        XX.\n        This spawns typically with the top-left 'dot' at (0, C3).\n        So, blocks are (0,C4), (0,C5), (1,C3), (1,C4).\n        If this piece is placed directly, it would raise C3 by 1, C4 by 2, C5 by 1.\n        Result: [3,3,3,4,2,1,0,0,0,0]. Still bad.\n\n        We need to move it right.\n        Let's re-evaluate the Z_Piece from typical Tetris.\n        The piece `Z` (often called S in other contexts for a different orientation, but assuming standard Z):\n        . X X\n        X X .\n        Blocks (relative to top-left corner of bounding box): (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1)\n        Spawn position usually places the center of the piece in the middle columns, high up.\n        Let's say it spawns at (C3, C4, C5). So, the blocks are at:\n        (C4, Y), (C5, Y)\n        (C3, Y-1), (C4, Y-1)\n\n        If placed at current C0 (meaning (1,0) block is at C0):\n        Would fill (C1,H), (C2,H) and (C0,H+1), (C1,H+1).\n        This isn't helpful with current board state.\n\n        Let's consider possible landing positions for the Z_Piece on the right side of the board.\n        Heights: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n        **Option 1: Place Z (default orientation) at C4**\n        `.XX` over `XX.` (top-left of bounding box at C3 usually)\n        Blocks: (C4,Y), (C5,Y), (C3,Y-1), (C4,Y-1)\n        We want to place it such that the lowest points are at the current board height (0) for C4+.\n        If we try to place the Z piece on columns C4, C5, C6:\n        The shape is 2 units tall, 3 units wide.\n        If placed horizontally from C4:\n        It would occupy (C4,0), (C5,0), (C5,1), (C6,1).\n        Resulting heights: [3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0].\n        This is: C4=1, C5=2, C6=1. It fills the gap and extends the board, but creates a small dip in C6.\n\n        **Option 2: Place Z (rotated orientation) at C4**\n        Rotate right once:\n        X .\n        X X\n        . X\n        Blocks: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n        Let's say this rotated Z piece (now 3 units tall, 2 units wide) is positioned with its leftmost block at C4.\n        The blocks would occupy:\n        (C4,0), (C4,1)\n        (C5,1), (C5,2)\n        Resulting heights: [3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0].\n        This makes C4=2, C5=2. This is a flatter profile, which is generally preferable for future placements.\n\n        Comparing Option 1 and 2:\n        Option 1 (horizontal, C4-C6): Max height on right is 2. `[...,1,2,1,...]`. Roughness 1 (between C4/C5) + 1 (between C5/C6).\n        Option 2 (rotated, C4-C5): Max height on right is 2. `[...,2,2,...]`. Roughness 0 (between C4/C5).\n        Option 2 is better due to lower roughness.\n\n        To achieve Option 2, the sequence of moves would be:\n        1. Rotate the Z-Piece once (e.g., `rotate_right`).\n        2. Move it right until its leftmost column is C4. (Assuming spawn is typically 3-5, it means moving right once or twice).\n\n        The first action to take is `rotate_right`.\n        The exact number of `RIGHT` moves depends on the specific spawn column of the Z-piece, which is not explicitly stated in the problem but usually is in the center columns. Let's assume the piece is centered when it spawns, covering C3, C4, C5 in its horizontal form.\n        Initial:\n        (C4,Y), (C5,Y)\n        (C3,Y-1), (C4,Y-1)\n\n        Rotate right:\n        (C3,Y), (C3,Y-1)\n        (C4,Y-1), (C4,Y-2)\n\n        We want the left-most block of the rotated piece to be in C4.\n        The leftmost blocks are (C3,Y) and (C3,Y-1). So this rotated piece needs to move `right`.\n        If the piece spawns with (C3,Y) as its left-most block, then to have its left-most block at C4, it needs one `RIGHT` move.\n        This would make its blocks:\n        (C4,Y), (C4,Y-1)\n        (C5,Y-1), (C5,Y-2)\n        This is exactly the shape and position for heights [3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0].\n\n        So the plan is: `rotate_right`, `right`.\n        The immediate action is `rotate_right`.\nthought: The current board has columns C0-C3 at height 3, and columns C4-C9 are completely empty (height 0). The active piece is a Z-Piece. The primary goal is to address the significant height difference and start building up the right side of the board (C4-C9) to create a flatter, more manageable surface, while avoiding creating new holes or raising the already high left side.\n\nLet's analyze the Z-Piece (standard Tetris definition: two horizontal blocks, with another two horizontal blocks below and shifted).\nStandard Z-Piece orientation:\n  . X X\n  X X .\n(Blocks at (col, row) relative to origin: (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1))\n\nRotated Z-Piece orientation (after `rotate_right`):\n  X .\n  X X\n  . X\n(Blocks at (col, row) relative to origin: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2))\n\nLet's evaluate potential placements for the Z-Piece on the right side of the board (C4-C9):\n\n1.  **Placing the Z-Piece in its standard (horizontal) orientation:**\n    If we place its leftmost block at column C4, it would occupy:\n    (C4,0), (C5,0) (the top two blocks)\n    (C3,1), (C4,1) (the bottom two blocks, which would fall on C3 and C4)\n    Wait, this assumes the Z-piece is `XX.` / `.XX`. If it's `.XX` / `XX.`:\n    Blocks: (C4,0), (C5,0) and (C3,1), (C4,1).\n    This would result in column heights: [3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This placement makes C3 even higher and creates a deep hole in C5 relative to C4. This is not ideal.\n\n    Let's use the more common Z piece orientation (or S-piece depending on game variation):\n    XX.\n    .XX\n    Blocks (relative to origin): (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)\n    If we place this piece with its leftmost block at C4:\n    It would occupy cells: (C4,0), (C5,0) (top part) and (C5,1), (C6,1) (bottom part, shifted right).\n    Resulting column heights: [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n    This starts building the right side. It creates heights C4=1, C5=2, C6=1. This introduces a slight unevenness (a small dip at C6 relative to C5), but is a reasonable starting point.\n\n2.  **Placing the Z-Piece in its rotated (vertical) orientation:**\n    After a `rotate_right` action, the Z-piece (if initially `XX./.XX`) becomes:\n    .X\n    XX\n    X.\n    Blocks (relative to origin): (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (0,2)\n    If we place this rotated piece such that its leftmost column is C4:\n    It would occupy cells: (C4,0), (C4,1) and (C5,1), (C5,2).\n    Resulting column heights: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    This is a better outcome. It creates a flat surface at height 2 across columns C4 and C5. This is more stable and easier to build upon.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy for this Z-Piece is to rotate it once to its vertical orientation and then position it to cover columns C4 and C5, creating a flat surface at height 2.\n\nThe first step in this plan is to `rotate_right`. The exact number of `RIGHT` moves would depend on the piece's initial spawn column, but `rotate_right` is the immediate necessary action.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right\n",
