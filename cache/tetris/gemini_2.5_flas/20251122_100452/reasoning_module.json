    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    There is no previous context. The board is in an early game state, mostly empty, with blocks only in the first three columns (`C0: 2, C1: 1, C2: 1`). The remaining columns (C3-C9) are completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Cannot assess, as there is no previous move or context provided.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The left side of the board (C0-C2) is slightly uneven. The active piece is an `I_Line`, which is powerful for clearing lines. Attention should be paid to either leveraging the `I_Line` to flatten the existing structure or to begin building a flat base for future line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the `I_Line` and the mostly empty board, the primary strategy should be to prepare for a Tetris (4-line clear) by building a flat surface and leaving a single column open as a \"well.\" Alternatively, use the `I_Line` to level out the existing `[2,1,1]` structure if a horizontal placement allows for minimal hole creation. Avoid creating early, unfillable holes.",
    "response": "thought: The board currently has heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I_Line.\nThe I-piece can be placed horizontally or vertically.\n\n**Horizontal placement:**\n*   Placing it at C0-C3 (initial position without moving) would result in heights [2, 1, 1, 1] if it lands on C0, which is incorrect. An I-piece placed horizontally occupies 4 cells in a row.\n    *   If placed at C0-C3: it would occupy `(y,0), (y,1), (y,2), (y,3)`. The current heights are C0:2, C1:1, C2:1. So, if it were to land on C0, it would create an overhang on C1 and C2, which is not good.\n    *   To place it flat at the bottom, it would need a column height of 0 for at least 4 consecutive columns. The earliest such spot is C3-C6, or C4-C7, C5-C8, C6-C9.\n    *   If placed horizontally on C6-C9 (requiring 6 'right' moves), it would sit on a clear base. This would create a flat base at height 0 (or 1 depending on spawning height) and keep the left side open for a future Tetris well, or to fill the small bumps. This is generally a good strategy for an I-piece.\n\n**Vertical placement:**\n*   A vertical I-piece occupies 4 cells in a single column.\n    *   If placed in C0, it would raise C0 to height 4, making C1 and C2 relatively low. This creates a large height difference.\n    *   If placed in C3 (requiring 3 'right' moves and a rotation), it would create a column of height 4 there, leaving an opportunity to fill C0-C2 and C4-C9.\n    *   Placing it vertically on the right side of the board (e.g., C9) would be a good start to building a Tetris well, but we would need to leave C9 empty for subsequent I-pieces. Given that the board is very early, building a well on the far right (C9) and placing this I-piece vertically in C8 (requiring ROTATE_RIGHT and 8 RIGHT moves) would be a good option.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the board. Heights are [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThe goal is to clear lines and keep the board flat or prepare for Tetris.\nAn I-piece is ideal for Tetris. To set up for Tetris, we want to leave one column clear and build up the other 9 columns evenly.\n\nOption 1: Build a flat base at height 0.\nThe best place to put the I-piece horizontally is in columns C6-C9. This would make the board heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] (assuming it lands at height 0, the actual landing height might be higher but the relative heights will be similar). This would require 6 RIGHT moves to get to C6.\n\nOption 2: Use the I-piece to \"clean up\" the existing mess on the left.\nThe heights are 2, 1, 1. If we place the I-piece horizontally in C0-C3, it would cover C0 and then land on the existing blocks, creating a non-flat surface. This is bad.\nIf we rotate it to be vertical and place it in C0, it raises C0 to 6. This is also not ideal.\n\nOption 3: Prepare for a Tetris well.\nA common strategy is to keep the far right column (C9) clear for I-pieces and build up the other columns.\nTo do this with an I-piece, we could place it horizontally in C0-C3, C1-C4, etc., or vertically in C8.\nIf we place it vertically in C8, it would require a `ROTATE_RIGHT` and 8 `RIGHT` moves. This would result in column heights [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. This is a good start for building a Tetris well in C9.\n\nLet's compare Option 1 (horizontal C6-C9) and Option 3 (vertical C8).\n\n*   **Option 1: Horizontal at C6-C9**\n    *   Actions: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT\n    *   Resulting relative heights (conceptual): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This keeps the overall height low and creates a mostly flat base, leaving the left side available for future pieces. It doesn't commit to a specific Tetris well strategy yet.\n\n*   **Option 3: Vertical at C8 (with C9 as well)**\n    *   Actions: ROTATE_RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT\n    *   Resulting relative heights (conceptual): [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. This explicitly sets up a well in C9 and starts building up C8.\n\nGiven the early state of the game, setting up for a Tetris well (Option 3) is a strong strategic play with an I-piece. The I-piece is at its most powerful when used for a Tetris. Leaving C9 clear and building up C8 provides a good foundation.\n\nThe I_Line spawns horizontally. To place it vertically in C8, it needs to be rotated right, then moved right until it's in C8.\nThe initial position of the I-piece is usually centered, spanning columns 3-6 if it's horizontal, or 4-7.\nLet's assume the I-piece spawns horizontally around the center, so its cells are roughly at `(Y, C3), (Y, C4), (Y, C5), (Y, C6)`.\nTo place it vertically in C8:\n1.  Rotate it once (ROTATE_RIGHT). Now it occupies one column, 4 cells high.\n2.  Move it to column C8. If it started in C4 (midpoint), it needs to move 4 times to the right. (C4 -> C5 -> C6 -> C7 -> C8). So 4 RIGHTs.\n    Let's refine the initial position. Standard Tetris usually spawns pieces with their leftmost block at column 3 or 4.\n    If the I-piece spawns horizontally with its leftmost block at C3, it occupies C3, C4, C5, C6.\n    If rotated right, it becomes a vertical piece. Its leftmost block (now lowest block) would still be initially aligned with C3.\n    To move it to C8, we need 5 `RIGHT` moves. (C3 -> C4 -> C5 -> C6 -> C7 -> C8).\n\nSo, the plan would be `ROTATE_RIGHT`, then 5 `RIGHT` moves.\nThe first action would be `ROTATE_RIGHT`.\nthought: The current board is very flat except for small bumps in C0, C1, and C2: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The active piece is an I_Line.\nThe I-piece is excellent for clearing four lines (Tetris). To prepare for this, a common strategy is to create a \"well\" by keeping one column completely clear, usually the far right (C9), and building up the other columns.\n\nTo execute this strategy with the current I-piece:\n1.  **Rotate the I-piece:** The I-piece spawns horizontally. To fit it into a single column, it must be rotated 90 degrees. `ROTATE_RIGHT` is a good choice.\n2.  **Position the I-piece:** After rotation, the I-piece will be 4 blocks tall and 1 block wide. We want to place it in C8, right next to the intended well in C9.\n    *   Assuming the I-piece spawns roughly centered (let's say its leftmost block is at C3 or C4 in horizontal orientation). After `ROTATE_RIGHT`, the piece will be vertical. If its initial vertical position is in C4, it needs to move `C8 - C4 = 4` times to the right. If it starts further left, more `RIGHT` moves are needed. Let's assume it starts centered (e.g., occupies C4) and we need to move it to C8, so 4 `RIGHT` moves. (C4->C5->C6->C7->C8).\n\nThe full sequence of actions to place the I-piece vertically in C8 would be: `ROTATE_RIGHT`, followed by a series of `RIGHT` moves. I will assume 5 `RIGHT` moves to be safe and account for potential exact spawn column. (e.g., if it spawns in C3, 5 `RIGHT` moves would take it to C8: C3->C4->C5->C6->C7->C8).\n\nThe immediate next action is to rotate the piece.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right, right, right, right\nmove: rotate_right",

To fit it into a single column, it must be rotated 90 degrees. `ROTATE_RIGHT` is a good choice.\n2.  **Position the I-piece:** After rotation, the I-piece will be 4 blocks tall and 1 block wide. We want to place it in C8, right next to the intended well in C9.\n    *   Assuming the I-piece spawns roughly centered (let's say its leftmost block is at C3 or C4 in horizontal orientation). After `ROTATE_RIGHT`, the piece will be vertical. If its initial vertical position is in C4, it needs to move `C8 - C4 = 4` times to the right. If it starts further left, more `RIGHT` moves are needed. Let's assume it starts centered (e.g., occupies C4) and we need to move it to C8, so 4 `RIGHT` moves. (C4->C5->C6->C7->C8).\n\nThe full sequence of actions to place the I-piece vertically in C8 would be: `ROTATE_RIGHT`, followed by a series of `RIGHT` moves. I will assume 5 `RIGHT` moves to be safe and account for potential exact spawn column. (e.g., if it spawns in C3, 5 `RIGHT` moves would take it to C8: C3->C4->C5->C6->C7->C8).\n\nThe immediate next action is to rotate the piece.\n\nPlacement_Plan: rotate_right, right, right, right, right, right",

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nAs I lack previous context, I cannot describe how the board has changed. However, the current board state shows a distinct structure: columns 0 through 3 are uniformly filled to a height of 3, while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWithout information on the last move or the thought process behind it, I cannot assess its effectiveness.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe primary area needing attention is the large open space on the right side of the board (columns 4-9). This area needs to be built up to prepare for line clears. The active piece, a Z-piece, is not ideal for clearing lines from the existing structure, nor for building a deep well immediately.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nGiven the Z-piece and the current board layout:\n*   **Build the Right Side:** The most logical approach is to begin filling the right side of the board. The Z-piece can be placed horizontally in columns 4-6 or 5-7 to start building a base.\n*   **Maintain Flatness (or create a new well):** Placing the Z-piece horizontally on columns 4 and 5 (with the 'tail' in column 6) would create a profile like `[3,3,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,0]`, which begins to bridge the gap and maintains a relatively flat surface.\n*   **Anticipate I-piece:** Strategically, it's often beneficial to build a flat surface and leave a single-column well (e.g., column 9) open for future I-pieces to clear multiple lines. The current Z-piece isn't suitable for this well formation directly, but its placement should keep this long-term goal in mind.\n*   **Avoid Holes:** Ensure the Z-piece placement does not create any new holes on the left side or within the new structure on the right.",
