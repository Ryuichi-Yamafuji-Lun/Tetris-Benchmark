Without knowing the shape of the active tetromino, it is impossible to formulate any optimal placement strategy. Any `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ROTATE_LEFT`, or `ROTATE_RIGHT` action would be a blind guess and could lead to a severely suboptimal or even game-ending placement once the piece is revealed or drops. Therefore, the only logical and safe action is to perform a `NO_OP`, effectively waiting for the next game state where the active piece's type is revealed, allowing for an informed decision.

  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes it impossible to formulate a truly optimal placement plan. However, the board state shows a significant imbalance, with high stacks on the left (columns 0-3) and an entirely empty right side (columns 4-9). The strategic goal must be to fill the empty right side to flatten the board and reduce the extreme height differential.\n\nGiven that the piece is unknown, any move is speculative. However, among the available actions, `RIGHT` is the most likely to be generally beneficial or least harmful. It shifts the piece away from the dangerously high left columns and towards the wide-open right side, where most future pieces should ideally be placed. `LEFT` would move it into a more precarious position. `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` carry the risk of changing the piece into an unhelpful orientation for its unknown shape and the current board layout. `NO_OP` would let it fall without any attempt to guide it towards the strategic objective.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable initial action is to move `RIGHT`, to begin positioning any piece towards the empty region, hoping it can contribute to filling the well. The 'Placement_Plan' for this turn is simply this initial corrective move, as subsequent actions depend entirely on the active piece's identity.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

Therefore, the safest and most rational move is to wait for the piece to be identified.\nthought: The board state shows very high columns on the left (0-3) and an entirely empty right side (4-9). The active piece is UNKNOWN. Since I don't know what piece is falling, I cannot make a plan for its placement.
