    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    This is the first observation, so there's no previous state to compare against. The board is currently very low and mostly empty, with the highest point at column 0 (height 2) and a shallow dip at columns 1 and 2 (heights 1 and 1 respectively). Columns 3 through 9 are completely clear.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of a last move, this cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is in an excellent, nearly empty state, offering maximum flexibility. The slight irregularity in columns 0-2 (heights `[2, 1, 1]`) is the only existing structure. The primary attention should be on establishing a wide, flat foundation, which is crucial for future stability and line-clearing efficiency.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an `I_Line`, which is excellent for clearing lines, especially Tetrises. Given the very clean board, the immediate strategy should be to maintain a low and flat profile. Placing the `I_Line` horizontally at the bottom of the board is ideal. Specifically, shifting the `I_Line` to cover columns 0-3 would effectively fill the existing `[2, 1, 1]` dip, creating a uniform base of height 3 on the left side of the board. This optimizes for future piece placements by keeping the surface flat and broad, while also potentially setting up a longer well on the right for subsequent Tetrises.\n\n**Action:**\nLEFT",

The active piece is an I_Line. The optimal strategy here is to flatten the board. Placing the I_Line horizontally across columns 0-3 would create a flat base of height 3 across these columns, effectively filling the existing dip. Assuming the I_Line spawns horizontally and centered (e.g., across columns 3-6), it would require multiple 'LEFT' moves to reach the target position (columns 0-3).

The left side (C0-C3) requires careful management to prevent an unmanageable stack, while the large empty expanse on the right (C4-C9) presents an opportunity for stacking but also a challenge to bridge or fill efficiently.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The most critical missing information is the `Active Piece`. Without knowing the current piece, specific strategic advice is limited. However, general strategy should focus on:\n    *   **Flattening the Board:** The priority should be to level out the significant height difference by clearing lines, especially from the left side (C0-C3).\n    *   **Efficient Stacking:** Utilize the wide-open space on the right (C4-C9) for clean stacking, but be mindful of how new pieces will interact with the existing structure on the left.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** Do not create new holes on the left side, and if possible, use incoming pieces to begin filling the C4-C9 area without forming new wells or isolated blocks.\n    *   **Anticipate I-piece:** An I-piece would be highly valuable to clear multiple lines if placed horizontally on the left, or to quickly build height on the right to match the left, preparing for a full line clear.\n    *   **Immediate Action:** The immediate focus must be to assess the next active piece and determine the best placement to either reduce the height on the left or begin building up the right without worsening the current imbalance.",

Columns C0, C1, C2 are significantly high (8, 8, 7), with C3 at height 4. Columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0).\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Lacking previous state information, I cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the last move.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing attention is the dramatic drop-off from Column 3 (height 4) to Column 4 (height 0). This creates a large, deep well on the right side. The tall stacks on the left (C0-C2) also need to be brought down.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal should be to bridge the gap between Column 3 and Column 4, and to start building up the completely empty right side (C4-C9) while simultaneously working to reduce the height of the left columns (C0-C2). With an unknown active piece, specific tactical advice is difficult, but generally, pieces should be prioritized to fill the right side and create a more level playing field. If an 'I' piece becomes available, it would be highly effective for clearing multiple lines horizontally across the current heights if oriented correctly, or for quickly building up the right side.",

This creates a massive, open well that will require significant effort to fill and level.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategic goal must be to address the extreme unevenness and the large gap on the right.\n    *   **Leveling the board:** Future pieces should prioritize filling in the empty columns (C4-C9) and lowering the tall columns (C0-C2).\n    *   **Bridging the gap:** Pieces that can span the height difference between C3 (height 4) and the empty C4-C9 are crucial to begin filling the right side.\n    *   **Line Clears:** Once pieces start to fill the right side, aim for horizontal line clears to reduce the overall board height, especially on the left.\n    *   **Active Piece Unknown:** The lack of information about the active piece makes immediate, precise tactical planning impossible. The strategy must remain general: use *any* incoming piece to mitigate the height difference and fill the empty space as much as possible, while always looking for opportunities to clear lines. Placing pieces in the empty columns is currently a higher priority than clearing lines on the high left side, as the empty right side creates significant instability and limits future placement options.",
    "response": "thought: The active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes it impossible to formulate an optimal and precise placement plan.

The most critical long-term goal is to fill the large void on the right side of the board and level the overall height.\n\nSince the piece is unknown, specific rotations or multiple horizontal movements cannot be planned accurately. However, a generalized initial move can be made to position the piece over the empty area.

This presents a massive opportunity for building a clearing well or flat surface, ideally for Tetrises.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The immediate priority is to capitalize on the vast empty space on the right side of the board (C4-C9).\n    *   **Clear Lines on the Right:** The primary strategy should be to direct pieces to the right to build up a flat surface or a single deep well (e.g., leaving C9 open for I-pieces) to enable rapid line clears, particularly Tetrises.\n    *   **Address the Left:** While clearing on the right, keep an eye on opportunities to shave down the high left columns (C0-C2) and fill the deep well at C3. Care must be taken not to create new holes on the left while trying to reduce height.\n    *   **Maintain Flexibility:** Given the height discrepancy, maintaining a wide, flat clearing area on the right is crucial for survival and generating points. Avoid creating new holes or rough terrain on the active clearing side.\n    *   **Piece Utilization (General):** Any incoming pieces should be evaluated first for their ability to contribute to a clearing setup on the right, then for their ability to mitigate the height and roughness on the left. The board configuration strongly favors horizontal line clears on the right.",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **Board Change:** This appears to be a new observation with no prior context. The board state is highly unusual: the left four columns (C0-C3) are uniformly filled to a significant height of 14, while the right six columns (C4-C9) are completely empty. This indicates a massive open well on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Cannot be assessed as there is no previous context or information about past moves.\n\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:** The absolute priority is to address the enormous empty space spanning columns C4-C9. This constitutes a deep, six-column wide well. While the left side is high, it's currently flat, which is preferable to unevenness.\n\n4.  **Strategic Insights for Future Moves:**\n    *   **Fill the well:** The immediate strategic objective must be to guide incoming pieces into the vast empty area on the right.\n    *   **Prioritize descent:** With such a deep well, focus on quickly moving pieces down and minimizing rotations unless absolutely necessary to fit or start forming a flat surface within the well.\n    *   **Horizontal Line Clears:** As pieces fill the right, aim to create horizontal lines to clear the bottom. This will effectively lower the \"floor\" of the play area and remove pieces from the left side if they get involved in clears.\n    *   **Maintain Flatness (Left):** While focusing on the right, be cautious not to create new holes or significant height disparities on the already high left side if possible.\n    *   **Height Management:** The overall height is high (14) on the left. Once the right side starts to fill, look for opportunities to clear lines and reduce the maximum height.",

The current board presents a highly unusual and extreme state.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior move history or context, it is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of any past actions.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is sharply divided:\n    *   **Critical Risk:** Columns 0-3 are dangerously high (14-16), nearing the top of the playfield. This left side needs to be managed extremely carefully to avoid game over.\n    *   **Major Opportunity:** Columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This massive well represents an excellent opportunity for multiple line clears, potentially including Tetrises, to reduce the overall board height.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The overriding strategy is to capitalize on the enormous empty space on the right (C4-C9) to clear lines and bring down the height, while simultaneously avoiding any placements that could prematurely end the game on the high left side (C0-C3).\n\n    A critical limitation is that the \"Active Piece\" is UNKNOWN. This makes precise tactical planning impossible. Without knowing the shape or current position of the falling piece, any movement is highly speculative. However, given the extreme board asymmetry, a general heuristic would be to:\n    *   Aim to direct pieces towards the empty right side (C4-C9) to maximize line clearing potential and keep pieces away from the dangerously high left columns.\n    *   Avoid creating new holes or unevenness on the right side as it's being filled, to maintain future clearing efficiency.\n\n    Due to the \"UNKNOWN\" active piece, selecting a truly optimal action is impossible.\n\n**Action:** RIGHT",

    "reflection": "**1. How has the board changed since previous states?**\nAs no previous context is available, I will describe the current state. The board is severely imbalanced. The left side (columns 0-3) is very high, with column heights of 18, 18, 16, and 14. In stark contrast, the right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty, all at height 0. This creates a massive, deep well spanning over half the board.\n\n**2. Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\nWith no previous context or knowledge of the active piece, I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the *last specific move*. However, the current board state indicates that the overall strategy leading to this configuration has been highly ineffective. Allowing such an extreme height differential to develop is a critical misplay that puts the game in a precarious position.\n\n**3. What areas of the board need attention?**\nThe primary area needing immediate attention is the **entire right side of the board (columns 4-9)**. This massive empty space must be filled to create a flatter, more manageable surface. Simultaneously, the **left side (columns 0-3)** is very high and potentially contains underlying holes, which need to be addressed as opportunities arise to clear lines and reduce overall height.\n\n**4. Any strategic insights for future moves?**\nThe overarching strategy must be to **aggressively build up columns 4-9**. Every piece should ideally be placed on the right side to reduce the height differential. Placing pieces on the left should be avoided unless it results in an immediate line clear or is absolutely necessary to prevent a game over. The current height of 18 in columns 0 and 1 means the game is close to ending, making survival and board flattening paramount. Given the `UNKNOWN` active piece, tactical decisions will be highly reactive: as soon as the piece is known, the immediate priority is to assess how it can best contribute to filling the right-side well while avoiding the creation of new holes or exacerbating the height on the left.",
    "response": "thought: The active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes it impossible to formulate a truly optimal placement plan. However, the board state shows a significant imbalance, with high stacks on the left (columns 0-3) and an entirely empty right side (columns 4-9). The strategic goal must be to fill the empty right side to flatten the board and reduce the extreme height differential.\n\nGiven that the piece is unknown, any move is speculative. However, among the available actions, `RIGHT` is the most likely to be generally beneficial or least harmful. It shifts the piece away from the dangerously high left columns and towards the wide-open right side, where most future pieces should ideally be placed. `LEFT` would move it into a more precarious position. `ROTATE_LEFT` or `ROTATE_RIGHT` carry the risk of changing the piece into an unhelpful orientation for its unknown shape and the current board layout. `NO_OP` would let it fall without any attempt to guide it towards the strategic objective.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable initial action is to move `RIGHT`, to begin positioning any piece towards the empty region, hoping it can contribute to filling the well. The 'Placement_Plan' for this turn is simply this initial corrective move, as subsequent actions depend entirely on the active piece's identity.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\nmove: right",

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    As there is no previous context, I cannot evaluate changes. The current board state shows a significant disparity: the left side (columns 0-3) is very high, with heights ranging from 14 to 19, while the right side (columns 4-9) is completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the last move's effectiveness is not possible.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The immediate concern is the high stack on the left (columns 0-3), particularly columns 1 and 2 at height 19, which are one block away from topping out. This area needs urgent line clears to reduce overall height. The vast, empty six-column well on the right (columns 4-9) also needs attention. It presents both an opportunity for building a Tetris setup and a risk of creating new, isolated high points if filled carelessly. It's likely there are holes within the left stack given the varied heights and lack of visibility.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary goal should be to lower the height of the left stack. Prioritize line clears on the left side to prevent an early game over. When considering placing pieces in the empty right section, aim to build a flat surface from the bottom up or carefully create a single well for future Tetris opportunities, rather than scattering pieces randomly. The large well could be used to set up a Tetris if an I-piece becomes available. With the active piece being UNKNOWN, general strategy is to prepare for any piece by aiming to create flat surfaces and clear lines.\n\n**Action:** NO_OP",

This allows the system to reveal the active piece in the next observation, at which point I can make an informed decision on how to place it.

The board is currently completely empty, with all column heights at 0.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no previous move to evaluate in this context.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is pristine and entirely clear. No specific areas require immediate attention due to existing holes or rough terrain. All columns are at height 0.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    With an empty board and an `I_Line` as the active piece, the primary strategic goal is to initiate a well-structured base for future line clears, specifically aiming for Tetrises. The `I_Line` is perfect for this. The most efficient use of the `I_Line` on an empty board is often to place it vertically along one of the side walls (e.g., column 0 or column 9) to establish a 1-wide Tetris well. This sets up a clear strategy for subsequent pieces to build around this well, maximizing Tetris opportunities.",
