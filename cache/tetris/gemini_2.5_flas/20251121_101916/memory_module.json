  "###Action\n(right, 1)\n###Thought\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN, which makes specific planning impossible. However, the board state shows columns 0-3 are very high (height 13) and columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a critical imbalance. Given the extreme height on the left, any placement there would increase the risk of a game over. The most prudent general strategy with an unknown piece is to move it towards the empty area to start building up the right side and alleviate the imbalance. Moving to the right is the best first blind move to attempt to shift the piece away from the dangerous left stack. I cannot specify a full placement plan without knowing the piece shape or how many moves it takes to get to an optimal position.\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\n(NO_OP, 1)\n###Thought\nThe board has a dangerous stack on the left (C0-C3 heights: 17, 17, 15, 13) and a massive empty well on the right (C4-C9 are all 0). The active piece is UNKNOWN. This is a critical situation as any piece could potentially top out the stack on the left if placed poorly, or could be used to set up a big clear in the well.\n\nGiven the active piece is UNKNOWN, I cannot plan a specific placement. However, I must assume a piece has just spawned at the top center. The default spawn location is usually around columns 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSince I don't know the piece, I cannot perform any rotations or specific lateral movements with certainty. If I choose an action like `LEFT` or `RIGHT` or `ROTATE_LEFT`/`ROTATE_RIGHT` without knowing the piece, I might misposition it immediately, especially if it's a piece that doesn't benefit from that initial move.\n\nThe most conservative and safest immediate action when the piece is UNKNOWN is `NO_OP`. This allows the piece to fall one step, which might reveal its type in the next observation, or at least confirm its initial position, enabling a more informed decision for the subsequent move. This is crucial because any premature movement or rotation could commit the piece to a suboptimal path before I even know what I'm dealing with.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable plan when the active piece is UNKNOWN is to wait for more information.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

The \"Active Piece: UNKNOWN\" makes specific placement planning impossible. However, the immediate strategic priority must be to guide any incoming piece away from the critically high left side and towards the empty right side to start building a new, lower foundation.
