The rest of the board (Columns 3-9) is completely clear.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without any previous context, it's impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the last move or the reasoning behind it.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The current board is relatively low, but the left side (C0-C2) has a slight irregularity. Column 0 is higher than C1 and C2. The vast empty space on the right (C3-C9) presents a clear opportunity for controlled building.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an `I_Line`, which is excellent for clearing lines, especially Tetrises. Given the large clear space on the right, the most impactful move would be to start establishing a flat base or preparing a Tetris well. Placing the `I_Line` horizontally in columns C3-C6 would build a strong foundation, or vertically in C9 to immediately create a Tetris well opening, would be strategic. Prioritizing horizontal placement to create a flat base on the right seems safer and more flexible for subsequent pieces.",

The active piece is an `I_Line`, which is ideal for clearing lines, especially Tetrises. A common and highly effective strategy with an I-piece on a relatively clear board is to set up a Tetris well on one side. The rightmost column (C9) is a good candidate for this. To achieve this, the horizontally-spawned `I_Line` needs to be rotated twice to become vertical, and then moved to the far right.

This needs to be built up in a controlled manner to either flatten the board or create a consistent well for future line clears. The current Z-piece is not ideal for perfectly flattening surfaces without creating small bumps.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current active piece is a Z-Piece, which is often challenging to place efficiently without creating unevenness, especially on a flat surface or when bridging a large gap. Given the wide-open right side and the Z-piece's shape, a prudent strategy would be to:\n    *   **Minimize height disparity:** Try to place the Z-piece in a way that *starts* to build up the right side while minimizing new holes or severe height differences.\n    *   **Utilize the Z-shape:** The Z-piece can sometimes be used to fill in smaller 2-block wide gaps or create specific overhangs, but in this open scenario, its primary use is to gradually build.\n    *   **Avoid creating 'canyons':** Placing the Z-piece directly against the existing wall might create an undesirable internal hole or a significant height difference, making future pieces harder to place.\n    *   **Consider a 'dump' move:** If no immediately beneficial placement is clear, moving the Z-piece to the far right (e.g., columns 7-9) to start building that side is often a safe, albeit not always optimal, default move to get a more versatile piece next.\n\n    For this specific Z-piece, placing it towards the middle-right of the empty section (e.g., columns 4-6 or 5-7) could begin to fill the gap and allow for future pieces to continue building a level foundation. However, to minimize immediate disruption to the existing \"cliff,\" placing it further to the right, affecting columns 6-8 or 7-9, might be the safest.\n\n    **Action Recommendation:** `RIGHT` (to shift the piece towards the open right side, preparing for a placement that begins to fill the gap without severely impacting the left wall or creating new, unfillable holes).",

The active piece is a Z-Piece in its default, horizontal orientation (XX over .XX).\n\nMy goal is to place the Z-piece to start filling the open right side (columns 4-9) while minimizing height differences and avoiding creating new holes.\n\nLet's analyze the potential placements for the Z-piece (default orientation):\nThe Z-piece typically covers three columns. Let's assume its left-most block is at column `C_L`. The shape will effectively raise `C_L` by 1 unit, `C_L+1` by 2 units, and `C_L+2` by 1 unit from its base.\n\n1.  **Placing its leftmost block in C2 (against the existing wall at C3):**\n    This would mean landing on C2, C3, C4.\n    Current heights: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    If Z lands on C2(height 3), C3(height 3), C4(height 0), it would create severe height differences and likely a hole under the Z-piece.\n    This would result in new heights like `[3, 3, 3+1, max(3+2, 0+1), 0+1, 0,0,0,0,0]` (approx), which is bad. The lowest points of the piece would align with the existing board, making C2 end up at height 4, C3 at 5, and C4 at 2. This creates significant jaggedness.\n\n2.  **Placing its leftmost block in C3:**\n    This would mean landing on C3, C4, C5.\n    Current heights: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    New heights would be approximately `[3, 3, 3, 3+1, 0+2, 0+1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (C3 at 4, C4 at 2, C5 at 1). Still creates a \"hole\" at C4 compared to C3.\n\n3.  **Placing its leftmost block in C4:**\n    This would mean landing on C4, C5, C6.\n    Current heights: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    The Z-piece would land on a flat surface of height 0.\n    C4 would become height 1. C5 would become height 2. C6 would become height 1.\n    Resulting heights: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]`\n    This creates a small bump but is a good way to start building up the empty side, maintaining a low max height (3) and no new holes.\n\n4.  **Placing its leftmost block further to the right (e.g., C5, C6, C7):**\n    These placements would also create similar bumps on the flat surface. For example, placing starting at C5 would give `[3,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0]`. The immediate gap to the left (C4) would remain height 0, creating a larger height difference with C3 and C5.\n\nConsidering the rotated Z-piece (vertical orientation):\nThis shape covers two columns, raising one by 2 and the other by 3. This tends to create steeper height differences and is less ideal for starting on a flat surface. For example, placing its leftmost block in C4 would result in `[3,3,3,3,2,3,0,0,0,0]`, creating a max height of 3 and a significant drop-off.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to place the horizontal Z-piece starting at column 4. This minimizes new holes and keeps the board relatively flat, allowing for easier future placements.\n\nStandard Z-piece spawn position typically has its leftmost block in column 2 (or 3, depending on exact game implementation).

This is the initial observation.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    *   As there is no previous context and the active piece is unknown, I cannot assess the effectiveness of any past move or thought process.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   The board is severely imbalanced. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are relatively high (7, 7, 6 respectively), while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). Column 3 is at height 3, acting as a small bridge.\n    *   The most critical area needing attention is the massive, deep valley spanning from column 3 to column 9. This vast empty space is both an opportunity and a hazard if not managed quickly.\n    *   Specifically, columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 need to be built up significantly to reduce the height disparity and flatten the board. Column 3 also needs to be built up to match the height of C2 (or C0/C1).\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** The overarching strategy must be to level the playing field by filling in the deep right side (columns 4-9).\n    *   **Bridge the Gap:** Focus on using incoming pieces to build up columns 3, 4, and 5 first, creating a gradual slope or a flat base to extend towards the right.\n    *   **Utilize Wide Pieces:** I-pieces, L-pieces, and J-pieces will be invaluable for spanning the open columns (4-9) and creating flat surfaces.\n    *   **Maintain Clearance Potential:** While building the right side, be mindful of the heights of C0-C2. Avoid creating new holes under them and try to keep them ready for line clears when possible, preventing them from topping out.\n    *   **Tetris Setup:** The wide-open space on the right presents a significant opportunity to set up a Tetris well once columns 4-8 are built up to a reasonable height. Aim to keep one column (e.g., C9) clear for future I-piece drops.\n    *   **Avoid Isolated Blocks:** As pieces are placed on the right, ensure they contribute to a cohesive, relatively flat surface to avoid creating new holes or rough terrain that will be difficult to fill later.",

However, the current board presents a highly imbalanced state. Columns 0, 1, and 2 are quite high (8, 9, 8 respectively), followed by column 3 at height 3. Columns 4 through 9 are entirely empty (height 0), creating a massive, deep well on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    As there is no previous context, the effectiveness of the last move cannot be assessed. However, the current board state, characterized by the extremely deep well on the right and relatively high stacks on the left, suggests a potential prior focus on clearing lines on the left without adequately managing the right side, or perhaps an attempt to set up a specific T-spin or line clear that left this significant gap.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing immediate attention is the vast empty space spanning columns 4 through 9. This six-column wide chasm is a major liability that needs to be filled efficiently to prevent an early game over. The unevenness on the left (columns 0-2 vs. column 3) also requires attention to avoid creating holes as new pieces are placed.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to fill the large empty space on the right (columns 4-9).\n    *   **Prioritize filling the well:** Future pieces should be directed towards filling columns 4-9, aiming to create a flatter, lower surface.\n    *   **Avoid creating new holes:** While filling, be cautious not to create new holes on the existing left stack or within the newly formed structures on the right.\n    *   **Focus on line clears:** As the right side is built up, prioritize opportunities for horizontal line clears to keep the board height manageable.\n    *   **Utilize long pieces (I-block):** An I-block would be incredibly valuable for bridging gaps or clearing multiple lines across the empty expanse.\n    *   **Maintain an accessible \"well\" if necessary:** If a new piece is not suitable for filling the entire gap, try to build up the right side in a way that maintains a 1- or 2-column wide \"well\" (e.g., for an I-piece) rather than an unmanageable deep pit.\n    *   **Active piece is UNKNOWN:** Given the active piece is unknown, the immediate action should be chosen to best contribute to filling the well or, failing that, to level out the left side without exacerbating the right-side problem.",

    "reflection": "1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Given \"None\" for previous context, I cannot describe changes. However, the current board state reveals a severe imbalance: columns C0, C1, C2 are high (10, 10, 11), C3 is at height 3, and columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This indicates a deep, wide well or trench on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context, evaluating the last move is impossible. However, the current highly unbalanced board with a significant void on the right suggests that recent operations have not been effective in maintaining a flat surface or clearing lines. The board is in a precarious state, likely due to pieces being placed primarily on the left.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most critical area needing immediate attention is the wide, empty section comprising columns C4 through C9. This void prevents any line clears and represents a significant structural weakness. Secondary attention is needed for the high columns on the left (C0-C2), but building up the right side is paramount to enabling future line clears.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to **fill the deep well on the right side (C4-C9)**. Any incoming piece, regardless of its shape, should be primarily aimed towards building up this area. The goal is to raise the height of columns C4-C9 to match or exceed C3, creating a more level surface suitable for line clears. We must be careful not to create new holes on the left as we try to fill the right. Since the active piece is UNKNOWN, a general \"move right\" strategy is advisable to initially position the piece over the empty columns.\n\n**Action:** RIGHT",

However, the current state suggests either a massive multi-line clear on the right or a deliberate strategy to leave a large open well.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Immediate Priority:** The vast empty space in columns C4 through C9 presents a prime opportunity for multiple line clears, potentially a Tetris if an 'I' piece is available. This area demands immediate attention to capitalize on the clear space.\n    *   **Secondary Concern:** The heights on the left (C0-C2) are approaching critical levels. While the right is open, ongoing management of the left stack is necessary to prevent an early game over.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Leverage the Right Well:** Prioritize placing pieces into the C4-C9 void to clear lines efficiently. An 'I' piece should be saved for a Tetris in this area.\n    *   **Build Conservatively:** When filling the right, aim to maintain a flat surface to avoid creating new holes and maximize future clearing potential.\n    *   **Adapt to Active Piece:** Given the active piece is UNKNOWN, the precise strategy remains fluid. However, the overarching goal should be to use incoming pieces to consolidate the board, favoring line clears on the right while keeping the left stable.",
    "response": "thought: The most critical piece of information, the `Active Piece`, is explicitly stated as UNKNOWN. This makes it impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan as I don't know the shape, rotation options, or how it interacts with the current board state. The board has a significant open well on the right (columns C4-C9 are at height 0), while the left side is stacked relatively high (C0:11, C1:12, C2:12, C3:3).\n\nGiven the absence of the active piece information, any action is a speculative guess. However, to comply with the request to provide an action, I will choose a generally safe and potentially useful initial move. Most pieces spawn in the middle columns. Moving a piece to the `RIGHT` is often a beneficial first step if the goal is to utilize the large open well on the right side of the board. This action is less committal than a rotation and moves the piece towards an area where it's safer to drop and easier to clear lines.

Columns 0-3 are at a significant height of 13, forming a tall wall, while columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a massive void to the right of the wall. The primary area needing attention is the entire board, with a focus on:\n    *   **Reducing height on the left:** Lines need to be cleared from columns 0-3 to prevent a game over.\n    *   **Filling the right void:** Columns 4-9 need to be built up to meet the height of the left side, preferably without creating new holes in the process.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current state is critical due to the high stack on the left. The `Active Piece` is unknown, which severely limits immediate strategic advice beyond general goals.\n    *   **Immediate Priority:** Survival. Aim to clear lines on the left side whenever possible to reduce the overall height.\n    *   **Board Balancing:** Any piece should ideally contribute to either clearing lines on the left or safely building up the right side to close the height gap.\n    *   **Hole Avoidance:** Be extremely careful when placing pieces on the right side (columns 4-9) to avoid creating any holes, as these would be difficult to fill and compound the problem.\n    *   **Building Strategy:** When building on the right, prioritize creating a flat surface or a clean well for future Tetris opportunities, but the immediate goal is just to *fill*.\n    *   **Aggressive Clearing:** If a piece allows for multiple line clears or a Tetris on the left side, that would be highly beneficial, even if it doesn't perfectly balance the board immediately.",

However, the board state shows columns 0-3 are very high (height 13) and columns 4-9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a critical imbalance.

The most prudent general strategy with an unknown piece is to move it towards the empty area to start building up the right side and alleviate the imbalance.

This space should be built upon to create a flat base for future line clears, potentially setting up for multiple Tetrises.\n    *   **Bridge the Gap:** Aim to place pieces that can connect the high left side to the empty right side, gradually leveling out the board's profile.\n    *   **Avoid Further Height Increases (Left):** Unless a line clear is guaranteed, avoid placing pieces that would increase the height in columns 0-3.\n    *   **Prepare for I-Piece:** If an I-piece becomes available, it could be critical for clearing multiple lines on the left or quickly building a uniform base on the right.",

This allows the piece to fall one step, which might reveal its type in the next observation, or at least confirm its initial position, enabling a more informed decision for the subsequent move.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    Without previous context, I cannot evaluate changes from prior states. However, the current board presents an extremely unbalanced and precarious state. Columns C0-C2 are critically high at 19, 19, and 18 units respectively, with C3 also elevated at 13 units. In stark contrast, columns C4-C9 are completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Information on the last move and its associated thought process is unavailable, preventing an assessment of its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Immediate attention is required on the left side (C0-C2) due to the critically high stacks, which are nearing the top of the playfield. This poses an imminent game-over threat. However, the most strategic area for long-term improvement and potential line clears is the vast, completely empty space on the right (C4-C9). This significant void represents both a challenge and a massive opportunity.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to direct all incoming pieces to the right side of the board (C4-C9) to begin filling it and establish a new, lower base. This will incrementally relieve pressure on the towering left columns and create significant clearing opportunities. Prioritize horizontal placements on the right to broaden the base and create a more level surface. Avoid adding to the already high left columns unless it results in an immediate line clear or is absolutely unavoidable. The goal is to systematically build up the right side, aiming to level out the board and prepare for multiple line clears (Tetrises) once a sufficient base is established. Given the \"Active Piece: UNKNOWN,\" specific piece planning is not possible, reinforcing the need for this general, fundamental rebalancing strategy.",

The \"Active Piece: UNKNOWN\" makes specific placement planning impossible. However, the immediate strategic priority must be to guide any incoming piece away from the critically high left side and towards the empty right side to start building a new, lower foundation. Moving the piece to the right is the most logical first step to achieve this, regardless of the piece's shape. This minimizes the risk of topping out on the left and begins to address the vast void on the right.\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, right, right, right (as many rights as needed to position the unknown piece over columns C4-C9)\nmove: right",

Given that there is no previous context, this signifies either the very beginning of a new game or a full board clear, effectively an initial state.\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There was no prior move to evaluate, as this appears to be the first decision point in the game.\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The entire board is clear and available. The primary focus is to initiate a strategic build that facilitates future line clears, specifically a Tetris (4-line) clear.\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The active piece is an `I_Line`. On a perfectly empty board, the optimal initial strategy for an I-piece is to orient it vertically and place it in either the leftmost or rightmost column. This creates a perfect four-block high well, which is essential for setting up subsequent Tetris clears. Placing it anywhere else or leaving it horizontal would immediately limit future Tetris opportunities. The immediate goal is to rotate the I-piece and then move it to an extreme column to establish this Tetris well.\n\nROTATE_RIGHT",
