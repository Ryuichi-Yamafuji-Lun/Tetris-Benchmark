  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe current game state indicates that the 'Active Piece' is UNKNOWN. Without knowing the shape or orientation of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan involving rotations or horizontal movements. Any such move would be a blind guess and could lead to a suboptimal or even game-ending position, especially given the critically high stack on the left side of the board (columns 0-3 are at height 13).\n\nThe most rational and safest action when the active piece is unknown is to perform a `NO_OP`. This allows the game state to progress by one tick, causing the unknown piece (if it has already spawned but its type is hidden) to fall one line, or allowing a new piece to potentially spawn and be revealed in the next observation. This approach minimizes risk and buys time to gain more information before committing to a strategic placement. Therefore, the immediate ideal action is to do nothing.\n\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe board has a critical situation on the left side (columns C0-C3 are very high) and a completely empty right side (C4-C9). The active piece is UNKNOWN, which means I cannot make a specific placement plan yet. My immediate goal is to observe the incoming piece. Since I don't know the piece, any movement or rotation would be arbitrary and potentially detrimental. Therefore, the safest and only logical move at this stage is to do nothing (`NO_OP`) and wait for the piece to be revealed in the next observation.\n\nOnce the piece is known, the strategy will be:\n1.  **Prioritize clearing lines on the left** if a piece can do so effectively without creating new holes or raising the height further.\n2.  **More likely, build a flat surface on the right** (columns C4-C9) to set up for a Tetris, which will significantly reduce the height on the left when cleared.\n3.  **Avoid topping out** on the left.\n\nFor now, with an `UNKNOWN` active piece, `NO_OP` is the only safe action.\nthought: The active piece is `UNKNOWN`. With no information about the shape of the falling piece, it's impossible to plan any rotations or horizontal movements optimally. Any premature action (left, right, rotate) could lead to a suboptimal or even detrimental placement once the piece is revealed. The safest and most logical first step is to do nothing and wait for the game to reveal the active piece.\n\nOnce the piece is known, the overall strategy should be to flatten the board, ideally by clearing lines on the left (C0-C3) or by setting up for a Tetris in the large empty space on the right (C4-C9).\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\n(right, 1)\n###Thought\nThe active piece is UNKNOWN, which severely limits the ability to plan an optimal placement. Without knowing the shape or orientation of the piece, it's impossible to determine specific rotations or precise landing spots for maximum line clears or minimal height increase.\n\nHowever, I must choose an action. Analyzing the board state reveals a critical feature:\n- Columns C0-C3 are significantly high (17, 17, 15, 13).\n- Columns C4-C9 are completely empty (0).\n\nThis creates a massive \"well\" on the right side of the board. The strategic priority should be to leverage this empty space for future line clears, potentially setting up for Tetrises. The default spawn position for a piece is typically in the upper-middle columns (e.g., C3-C6 or similar).\n\nGiven the unknown piece:\n1.  **Hard Drop** is too risky as it commits to an unknown placement.\n2.  **Soft Drop** or **NO_OP** would allow the piece to fall, potentially revealing its shape, but the system expects an immediate \"move\" decision that initiates a placement plan.\n3.  **Rotate Left/Right** is a pure gamble without knowing the piece shape.\n4.  **Move Left** would push the unknown piece further towards the already high and congested left side of the board, which is generally undesirable.\n5.  **Move Right** would shift the unknown piece towards the expansive empty region on the right (C4-C9). This is the most generally beneficial speculative first move, as it moves the piece away from the high stack and positions it closer to an area where it can contribute to building a flat surface for line clears. While a full placement plan is impossible due to the unknown piece, a single \"RIGHT\" move is the most logical initial step to guide any piece towards the open well.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe primary challenge is that the `Active Piece` is listed as `UNKNOWN`. This prevents specific tactical planning regarding rotations or exact placement based on the piece's shape.\n\nGiven this constraint, I must choose a generic action that is most likely to be beneficial or least harmful across all possible piece types, considering the current board state.\n\nCurrent Board State Analysis:\n- Columns 0, 1, and 2 are at heights 19, 19, and 18 respectively, meaning the board is critically high on the left side, just one or two blocks from topping out.\n- Column 3 is at height 13.\n- Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). This represents a massive opportunity for line clears and recovery if pieces can be placed there.\n\nConsidering the `UNKNOWN` active piece:\n1.  **NO_OP**: This would let the piece fall one row. If the piece is tall (e.g., an 'I' piece spawning vertically) and it's currently centered, letting it fall might cause it to top out on the left side. This is a high-risk move without knowing the piece.\n2.  **ROTATE_LEFT / ROTATE_RIGHT**: These are extremely risky without knowing the piece's shape. A rotation could put the piece in an unrecoverable position or stick it to an undesirable height.\n3.  **LEFT**: Moving left would bring the piece closer to the already dangerously high columns 0-2. This increases the risk of topping out.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moving right shifts the piece away from the critical left-hand danger zone and towards the completely empty columns (4-9). For almost any piece type, getting it closer to the empty right side is the most advantageous initial positioning, as this area offers the most room for safe placement and potential line clears. This move minimizes immediate risk and sets up for future opportunities.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and safest first action, when the active piece is `UNKNOWN`, is to move it `RIGHT` to steer it towards the open side of the board and away from the critical heights on the left. My intention is to continue moving it right to place it over the empty columns.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, right, right, right (assuming it spawns in the center and needs to move to the far right)\n",

  "###Action\nNO_OP\n###Thought\nThe board is completely clear, indicated by the column heights `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. However, the `Active Piece` is listed as `UNKNOWN`. Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it's impossible to plan any specific rotations or horizontal movements to achieve an optimal placement. Any movement or rotation would be random and likely suboptimal. The safest action in this situation is to do nothing (`NO_OP`) to allow the game to update, hopefully revealing the piece in the next state, or for the piece to fall one step, which might clarify its type. A `HARD_DROP` would commit to an unknown placement, which is not advisable.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n"
