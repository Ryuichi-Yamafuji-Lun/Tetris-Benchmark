The current state shows a very clean and low board, with heights `[2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The board is largely empty and low. Columns C0, C1, and C2 have pieces, with a slight dip in C1 and C2 (height 1) compared to C0 (height 2). The right side (C3-C9) is completely clear. Attention should be paid to integrating new pieces smoothly into the existing structure on the left or starting new structures on the right, ensuring no holes are created.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current board state is excellent \u2013 very low and open. The primary strategy should be to maintain this flatness and keep the board as low as possible. Given the wide-open right side, it's an opportune moment to set up for potential Tetrises (by creating a 4-wide vertical well) or T-spins if an appropriate piece (T-mino) arrives. Prioritize placing pieces on the right to build up evenly, or slotting them into C0-C2 to smooth out the existing height difference. Avoid creating holes under any circumstances. Without knowing the active piece, the general goal is to keep options open and build low and wide.",

Placing pieces primarily in these empty columns is crucial to prevent the well from becoming an insurmountable problem as heights increase.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy should be to **prioritize building up columns 4-9**. We need to focus on placing pieces into the deep well to raise the floor and create opportunities for line clears. While doing so, it's important to **maintain a flat surface** on top of the rising blocks to avoid creating new holes. Since the active piece is unknown, this will require adaptability, but the general directive is to direct pieces to the right side of the board to address the current height disparity. Avoid building higher on the left side unless it's for an immediate line clear.",

Columns C0 and C1 are at height 5, while C2 and C3 are at height 3. The most significant feature is that columns C4 through C9 are completely empty (height 0). This creates a very deep and wide \"valley\" on the right side of the board.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    With no previous context provided, I cannot assess how the board has changed. However, the current board state shows column heights `[7, 7, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This indicates a significant gap or very low build on the right side of the board (columns 4-9 are completely empty), while the left side has some irregular build-up.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    Without prior observations or a record of the last move, it's impossible to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The most striking feature is the wide-open right side (columns 4-9). This area is completely clear and offers a prime opportunity for clean building and line clears. The left side (columns 0-3) has a height difference of 4 between the highest (C0, C1 at 7) and lowest (C3 at 3) point, indicating some unevenness that could lead to holes if not managed carefully. The goal should be to maintain this emptiness on the right for potential Tetris opportunities or to build a clean stack.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The current board state is favorable for establishing a Tetris-ready well on the right.\n    *   **Prioritize a flat base:** With the right side empty, focus on keeping it clear or building a low, flat base to maximize future line clear potential.\n    *   **Prepare for an I-piece:** The open right side is ideal for a Tetris clear if an I-piece is received.\n    *   **Manage the left:** Any pieces that don't fit well into a clean build on the right should be placed on the left, aiming to flatten the existing structure or fill any emerging gaps without creating new holes.\n    *   **Active Piece: UNKNOWN:** Given the active piece is unknown, specific tactical advice is impossible. However, the general strategy should revolve around preparing the board for efficient line clears.\n\n**Next Action (based on current observation and general strategy, assuming an unknown piece):**\nGiven the unknown active piece, the safest and most flexible initial action is often to allow gravity to place the piece or a slight adjustment. Without knowing the piece or the next piece, it's hard to make a truly strategic placement. However, typically, a *NO_OP* allows more time to evaluate or a *SOFT_DROP* can commit to a quick placement if the situation is urgent. If I had to pick one without any piece information, I would prioritize observing the piece first.\n\nHowever, since I must choose an action from the list and without knowing the `Active Piece`, I cannot make an informed placement decision. My primary goal right now would be to identify the active piece to make a strategic placement. Assuming the system needs an *action* and not just a desire for more info, and without more context, I will choose a NO_OP to wait for piece info or further board analysis if there are implicit delays.\n\n`NO_OP`",

However, the current board shows extreme unevenness, with significant height on the left (columns 0-2 at 8-9 units high) and a massive open well on the right (columns 4-9 are completely empty). Column 3 is a mid-height transition at 3 units.\n2.  **Last Move Effectiveness:** Cannot assess the effectiveness of the last move without knowing the previous state or the active piece.\n3.  **Areas Needing Attention:**\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C2):** These columns are very high and need immediate attention to bring down their height and avoid topping out.\n    *   **Right Well (C4-C9):** This deep open space is a prime target for a Tetris clear, but also a challenge to fill efficiently without creating new holes.\n    *   **Column 3 (C3):** This column is crucial. It's currently low, acting as a potential bridge or a point where a hole could be inadvertently created if pieces are placed carelessly into the right well.\n4.  **Strategic Insights:**\n    *   **Leveling Priority:** The immediate strategic goal is to level the board. Prioritize placing pieces to reduce the height of columns 0-2, ideally by clearing lines.\n    *   **Tetris Opportunity:** The vast open space on the right (C4-C9) presents a clear opportunity for a Tetris (4-line clear) if an I-Tetromino becomes available. Preparing for this by keeping the right side clear of obstructions and column 3 open is vital.\n    *   **Hole Avoidance:** Be extremely cautious to avoid creating holes under the high stacks on the left or in column 3 as pieces are placed.\n    *   **Adaptability:** Given the UNKNOWN active piece, the AI must remain adaptable, but the overarching goal is to prepare for and execute a Tetris while managing the high left side.",

Columns 0, 1, and 2 are significantly high (10, 10, 11 respectively), while columns 4 through 9 are completely empty.\n    *   **Column 3:** This column, with a height of 3, forms a deep well relative to the high left side and is a crucial transition point to the empty right side. Careful placement here is essential to either bridge the gap or create a strategic clearing opportunity.\n    *   **Left Side (C0-C2):** These columns are dangerously high and are at risk of topping out. They require immediate attention to clear lines and reduce height.\n    *   **Right Side (C4-C9):** This large empty expanse represents both an opportunity for many line clears and a challenge to build up evenly without creating inaccessible holes.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Prioritize Leveling:** The overarching strategy must be to level the board. Future pieces should primarily aim to reduce the height of columns 0-2 while gradually building a flat base in columns 4-9.\n    *   **Clear Lines on Left:** Seek out any opportunity to clear lines that involve the high columns (0-2) to bring the board height down.\n    *   **Controlled Expansion to Right:** When placing pieces in the empty columns (4-9), aim to build a clean, flat surface to prepare for future line clears. Avoid creating new holes or unevenness.\n    *   **Manage Column 3 Carefully:** Depending on the active piece, C3 could be filled to either support the high left side or start a new, lower base connecting to the right. Avoid making it an unfillable gap.\n    *   **Adaptive Play (Unknown Piece):** Since the active piece is unknown, the AI must remain highly flexible. The immediate goal is survival by managing the critical height difference, with a long-term goal of flattening the board.",

This represents both a large opportunity for building and a challenge due to the drastic height difference.\n4.  **Strategic insights for future moves:**\n    *   **Prioritize Line Clears on the Left:** Focus on clearing lines that involve columns C0, C1, and C2 to reduce the board's overall height and bring it down from the top.\n    *   **Build the Right Side Systematically:** Begin to build up columns C4-C9 from the bottom. Aim for flat placements initially to create a stable base, preventing new holes.\n    *   **Address C3 Carefully:** Look for opportunities to fill the deep valley at C3, ideally with pieces that can also contribute to a line clear or extend the build towards the right.\n    *   **Maintain Flatness:** Given the current severe imbalance, avoid creating any new holes, especially on the already complex left side.

However, the current board exhibits a severe imbalance: columns 0-3 are highly stacked (height 13), while columns 4-9 are completely empty.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    There is no prior move to evaluate in this context.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    The left side (columns 0-3) is critically high, indicating an urgent need for line clears to prevent a game over. The vast empty space on the right (columns 4-9) needs to be built upon to create future clearing opportunities and reduce board height.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    The primary strategy must be to **clear lines on the left side** to lower the dangerous stack, and simultaneously **begin building a base in the empty columns on the right**. Avoid placing pieces that only add to the height of columns 0-3 without clearing lines. Given the 'UNKNOWN' active piece, flexibility is key; prioritize any placement that leads to a line clear or begins to level the board.",

Without knowing the shape or orientation of the active piece, it is impossible to formulate an optimal placement plan involving rotations or horizontal movements. Any such move would be a blind guess and could lead to a suboptimal or even game-ending position, especially given the critically high stack on the left side of the board (columns 0-3 are at height 13).\n\nThe most rational and safest action when the active piece is unknown is to perform a `NO_OP`. This allows the game state to progress by one tick, causing the unknown piece (if it has already spawned but its type is hidden) to fall one line, or allowing a new piece to potentially spawn and be revealed in the next observation. This approach minimizes risk and buys time to gain more information before committing to a strategic placement.

    "reflection": "**Reflection:**\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    *   No previous context is available, so I cannot determine how the board has changed. This is the initial observation for reflection.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    *   No previous moves or thought processes are available for evaluation.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    *   **Critical Danger (Left Side):** Columns 0, 1, and 2 are at heights 19, 19, and 18 respectively. This means the board is one or two blocks away from topping out on the far left. Immediate attention is required to prevent a game over.\n    *   **Massive Opportunity (Right Side):** Columns 4 through 9 are all at height 0, indicating a completely empty right side of the board. This presents an enormous opportunity for extensive line clears, particularly Tetris clears, if pieces can be effectively maneuvered into this region.\n    *   **The Gap:** There is a significant height differential between column 3 (height 13) and column 4 (height 0). Bridging this gap effectively to utilize the empty right side without creating more unfillable holes on the left is a major challenge.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    *   **Immediate Survival:** The absolute priority is to avoid topping out on the left. Any piece that can fit into columns 0-3 without increasing the max height (e.g., clearing a line) should be considered.\n    *   **Leverage the Void:** While dangerous, the empty right side (columns 4-9) is the key to recovery and scoring. The long-term strategy must involve funneling pieces into this area to build up for multi-line clears.\n    *   **Address `UNKNOWN` Active Piece:** The current piece being `UNKNOWN` severely limits precise strategic planning. General principles must be applied:\n        *   **Avoid creating new holes** under the high stacks (C0-C3).\n        *   **Prioritize line clears** whenever possible, especially if they reduce height on the left.\n        *   **Look for opportunities to lower the height of C0-C3**, even if it means sacrificing perfect setups for the empty right side in the short term.\n        *   If the active piece turns out to be an 'I' piece, it could be used for a Tetris clear on the right side if the board can be built up appropriately, but this is a long shot given the current state.\n    *   **Adaptive Play:** Given the high risk and high reward scenario, the AI must be highly adaptive, focusing on immediate threat mitigation while constantly looking for ways to exploit the empty right side when the active piece allows.\n\nThe board is in a precarious state: on the verge of topping out on the left, but with a wide-open right side offering a chance for a massive comeback. Tactical piece placement is critical.",
    "response": "thought: The primary challenge is that the `Active Piece` is listed as `UNKNOWN`. This prevents specific tactical planning regarding rotations or exact placement based on the piece's shape.\n\nGiven this constraint, I must choose a generic action that is most likely to be beneficial or least harmful across all possible piece types, considering the current board state.\n\nCurrent Board State Analysis:\n- Columns 0, 1, and 2 are at heights 19, 19, and 18 respectively, meaning the board is critically high on the left side, just one or two blocks from topping out.\n- Column 3 is at height 13.\n- Columns 4 through 9 are completely empty (height 0). This represents a massive opportunity for line clears and recovery if pieces can be placed there.\n\nConsidering the `UNKNOWN` active piece:\n1.  **NO_OP**: This would let the piece fall one row. If the piece is tall (e.g., an 'I' piece spawning vertically) and it's currently centered, letting it fall might cause it to top out on the left side. This is a high-risk move without knowing the piece.\n2.  **ROTATE_LEFT / ROTATE_RIGHT**: These are extremely risky without knowing the piece's shape. A rotation could put the piece in an unrecoverable position or stick it to an undesirable height.\n3.  **LEFT**: Moving left would bring the piece closer to the already dangerously high columns 0-2. This increases the risk of topping out.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moving right shifts the piece away from the critical left-hand danger zone and towards the completely empty columns (4-9). For almost any piece type, getting it closer to the empty right side is the most advantageous initial positioning, as this area offers the most room for safe placement and potential line clears. This move minimizes immediate risk and sets up for future opportunities.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and safest first action, when the active piece is `UNKNOWN`, is to move it `RIGHT` to steer it towards the open side of the board and away from the critical heights on the left. My intention is to continue moving it right to place it over the empty columns.\n\nPlacement_Plan: right, right, right, right, right, right (assuming it spawns in the center and needs to move to the far right)\nmove: right",

    "reflection": "The `Column Heights Vector (C0 to C9): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` indicates a completely clear board. Despite the complex `Aggregate Stats` which seem to encode a dense state, the primary board height summary shows a fresh start.\n\n1.  **How has the board changed since previous states?**\n    The board appears to have been completely cleared, suggesting either the start of a new game or a highly effective sequence of moves leading to a perfect clear. Without previous context, the precise nature of the change cannot be determined, but the outcome is a clean slate.\n\n2.  **Was the last move (and thought process) effective?**\n    With no previous context or knowledge of the last move, its effectiveness cannot be assessed. However, achieving a completely clear board is generally the result of highly effective gameplay.\n\n3.  **What areas of the board need attention?**\n    Currently, no areas require immediate attention for clearing. All columns are at height zero. Attention should be on establishing a low, flat foundation as new pieces arrive.\n\n4.  **Any strategic insights for future moves?**\n    Given the clear board and an `UNKNOWN` active piece, the primary strategy is conservative build-up:\n    *   **Foundation:** Prioritize creating a flat, low-lying base to maximize future options.\n    *   **Avoid Holes:** Prevent any internal gaps in the stack.\n    *   **Flexibility:** Keep the board as open as possible to accommodate various incoming pieces.\n    *   **Tetris Prep (Optional):** If an I-piece is desired for high scores, consider leaving a single column (e.g., C9) open for a vertical clear, but this is less critical than maintaining flatness initially.\n\nWithout knowing the active piece, specific placements are impossible, so general good building practices are key.",

Without knowing the shape of the active piece, it's impossible to plan any specific rotations or horizontal movements to achieve an optimal placement. Any movement or rotation would be random and likely suboptimal. The safest action in this situation is to do nothing (`NO_OP`) to allow the game to update, hopefully revealing the piece in the next state, or for the piece to fall one step, which might clarify its type.
