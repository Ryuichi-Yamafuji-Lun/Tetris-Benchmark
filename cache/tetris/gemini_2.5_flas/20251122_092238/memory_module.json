  "###Action\nright\n###Thought\nThe game state indicates a board with very high columns on the left (C0-C3: 14, 15, 15, 13) and entirely empty columns on the right (C4-C9: all 0s). The active piece is UNKNOWN. This is a crucial piece of missing information.\n\nGiven that the active piece is UNKNOWN, I cannot make a specific placement plan. I cannot know what rotations or horizontal movements would be optimal. The available actions are NO_OP, LEFT, RIGHT, ROTATE_LEFT, ROTATE_RIGHT.\n\nSince I don't know the piece, any move is essentially a guess. However, the system requires me to provide an action. In a situation where the active piece is unknown, and the board is severely imbalanced, making a move that doesn't commit too much or create immediate problems is safer.\n\n- **NO_OP:** This would let the piece fall without any input. If the piece is something like an I-piece, it might land awkwardly. If it's a square, it might just drop in the middle.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** These move the piece horizontally. Without knowing the shape, I don't know if this is beneficial or detrimental.\n- **ROTATE_LEFT/ROTATE_RIGHT:** These change the orientation. Again, without knowing the piece, this is a blind guess.\n\nThe \"Aggregate Stats\" provided are a long list of numbers, and it's unclear how to interpret them without more context (e.g., what each number represents - holes, roughness, etc.). The provided text mentions \"Aggregate Stats (Holes, Roughness, Next Piece Type, etc.)\" followed by `[15, 21, 16, 16, 15, 13, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 21, 16, 14, 15, 15, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]` This looks like a list of *possible* feature sets for *different hypothetical pieces/placements*, not a single aggregate stat for the current board state *before* a piece is placed. The most reliable information is the column heights.\n\nSince I am forced to pick an action and cannot perform an optimal placement without knowing the piece, I must choose the safest default. If the piece is an I, O, T, S, Z, J, or L, a single rotation or a single horizontal move might be enough to set it up for a good position.\n\nHowever, given the extreme height disparity (columns 0-3 are high, 4-9 are empty), the piece will *start* in the middle. Moving it even one step left might cause it to interact with the high left side, which is very dangerous. Moving it right would move it towards the empty area, which is safer. Rotating might change its width and make it more or less likely to hit the high wall.\n\nA `NO_OP` means the piece falls from its initial spawn position (usually centered). If the piece is tall (like an I-piece unrotated or a J/L piece), it might immediately hit the high left side if it spawns too close to column 4, or it might fall into the empty area.\n\nLet's assume standard Tetris spawning, where pieces typically spawn spanning columns 3-6 (or similar, centered).\n- If it spawns centered, and I do a `NO_OP`, it will fall. If it's a wide piece (like the I-piece horizontal), it will likely cover columns 3-6. This is problematic as columns 3 and 4 are very different heights (13 vs 0).\n- If I move `LEFT`, it will definitely interact with the high left side, which is dangerous.\n- If I move `RIGHT`, it will move towards the empty right side. This *could* be safer, as it might drop without immediately contacting the high left wall.\n\nHowever, without knowing the piece, even moving right is a guess. What if the piece is tall and thin and a `RIGHT` move makes it land in a worse spot later?\n\nConsidering the goal is to clear lines and avoid stacking too high:\n1. The left side is very high. Any piece landing there will increase the height and risk topping out.\n2. The right side is completely empty. This is where we want to build.\n\nTherefore, moving the piece towards the empty right side is generally a safer *initial* guess than moving it towards the high left side. A single `RIGHT` move is a minimal commitment. Rotating without knowing the piece is too risky, as it could orient it into a wide, problematic shape or a very tall one.\n\nSince I must pick an action, and the piece is UNKNOWN, the most general \"safe-ish\" direction given the board imbalance is to move towards the empty side. One `RIGHT` action shifts it slightly away from the dangerous high stack. This doesn't commit to a final placement but steers it away from immediate danger.\n\nEven then, the `Placement_Plan` is impossible to generate fully without the active piece. I will state the current chosen action and acknowledge the impossibility of a full plan.\n\nGiven the constraint to provide a \"Placement_Plan\", I will state that the plan is unknown due to the unknown piece. However, I *must* output an action.\n\nIf I were to pick the absolute *safest* action when a piece is unknown, it would be `NO_OP` because it makes no immediate changes to the piece's state beyond letting it fall from its default spawn. But this also implies letting it drop to its final position, which might be terrible.\n\nA `RIGHT` move would shift its initial position. The board is so imbalanced (13-15 vs 0) that any piece falling in the middle will create a massive height difference in columns 3-4. Moving `RIGHT` might place the piece entirely over the empty columns.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. The piece starts in the middle. Moving it RIGHT once would shift it right by one column. This seems like a reasonable initial action to explore options on the right side of the board which is currently empty and represents a safe area to build.\n\nSince I *cannot* know the optimal full placement, my \"Placement_Plan\" will reflect that it's a guess. I will choose a single `RIGHT` move as the initial attempt to direct the piece towards the open side.\nI cannot specify a frame count, as it's not provided in the example or instructions to be selected. The example `move: (rotate_right, 1)` implies I should just provide `(action_name, 1)`. I will just provide `action_name`.\nThe instructions say: `move: [chosen_action_string]` and then below, `move: (action_name_from_list, frame_count)`. I will follow the first format since no frame count is given in the problem and the example is conflicting. Let's assume the example means `move: rotate_right` and `1` is an example value for a frame count, which I don't need to specify. No, the example is quite explicit: `move: (rotate_right, 1)`. This means I need to include the \"1\". I will assume \"1\" is a default or placeholder for any action to indicate it's a single step of that action.\n\nI will attempt a single `RIGHT` move.\nthought: The active piece is UNKNOWN, making it impossible to formulate a truly optimal `Placement_Plan`. However, I must choose an action. The board is severely imbalanced with high stacks on the left (C0-C3) and completely empty columns on the right (C4-C9). Standard Tetris pieces usually spawn centered. Moving the piece towards the empty right side (C4-C9) is a generally safer initial action than moving it towards the already high left side, which risks topping out or creating more holes. A single `RIGHT` move is a minimal commitment to steer the piece away from the immediate danger zone on the left. Given the constraints, a full `Placement_Plan` for an unknown piece is impossible, so I will denote it as such.\nPlacement_Plan: UNKNOWN_PIECE, cannot_plan_fully_but_initial_action_is_right\n",

The safest strategy in this situation is to perform a NO_OP, allowing the piece to drop one step, in the hope that its type will be revealed in the subsequent observation, enabling a more informed decision.\nPlacement_Plan: NO_OP\n",

  "###Action\n(right, 1)\n###Thought\nThe board is in a critical state, with columns C0, C1, and C2 at heights 19, 19, and 18 respectively, very close to the top. The active piece is UNKNOWN. With an unknown piece, it's impossible to plan a specific placement for line clears or optimal stacking. The immediate priority is survival and avoiding increasing the height of the most critical columns on the left. Moving the piece towards the right, into the completely empty columns C4-C9, is the safest immediate action. This moves the piece away from the high stack and gives me a chance to identify the piece on the next turn to make a more informed decision. Any rotation or movement to the left without knowing the piece shape is too risky.\nPlacement_Plan: right\n",

The optimal first move in an empty board is to place the I_Line horizontally to create a flat base. I will assume the I-piece spawns horizontally and centered (columns 3, 4, 5, 6). To prepare for future Tetrises and leave a clear well (e.g., on the right side, column 9), I will move the I-piece to the far left, covering columns 0, 1, 2, 3. This requires three 'left' movements.
